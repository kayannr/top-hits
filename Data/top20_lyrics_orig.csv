francisco gonzález bocanegra en 1853 mientras que su música obra del músico español jaime nunó fue compuesta al año siguiente en su versión original el himno está compuesto por diez estrofas pero en los noventa años que pasó para su oficialización pasó por varias modificaciones o intentos de modificación quedando reducido solo a cuatro estrofas y el estribillo a partir de 1943 cuando fue

guirnaldas de oliva un recuerdo para ellos de gloria un laurel para ti de victoria un sepulcro para ellos de honor oficialmente en 1943 el texto del himno nacional fue completamente publicado con sus diez estrofas y estribillo pero algunas se recortaron porque hacían referencia a santa anna por eso se recortó a solo cuatro estrofas que son las estrofas i v vi y x de la versión original y el estribillo la modificación de la letra fue ordenada primero por el presidente manuel ávila camacho pero solo se oficializó en 1984 por el presidente miguel de la madrid hurtado a las cuatro estrofas

eventos deportivos tales como los juegos olímpicos las únicas partes del himno que pueden interpretarse o reproducirse son estribillo y estrofa i otras salvedades son para otros casos como los cierres y aperturas de trasmisiones de estaciones de radio o televisión pueden alterar dentro de las cuatro estrofas oficiales y previa autorización de la secretaría de gobernación la versión que transmiten aunque nunca pueden acortar las versiones completas que se producen durante ceremonias oficiales en ceremonias oficiales en territorio mexicano de instituciones públicas y privadas donde deba tocarse el himno nacional y otro extranjero se ejecutará en primer lugar el mexicano pero si existe un protocolo como en los juegos olímpicos se interpretará de acuerdo al orden que marque el protocolo correspondiente de ese acto por otro lado su uso como distintivo de honor se ejecuta acompañado de otra música por ejemplo para hacer honores al presidente de la república las bandas militares presentes tocarán la marcha de honor el caso de honores a la bandera las bandas de música ejecutarán el himno y a la vez las bandas militares tocarán la marcha llamada bandera y establece un límite a sus interpretaciones en ese caso dos veces para hacer honores a la bandera y rendir honores al presidente de la república aunque se indica la salvedad de que cuando sea interpretado por un coro las bandas militares deberán permanecer en silencio para apagar al coro en cualquier caso los presentes deberán demostrar el respecto asumiendo la posición de firme y en caso de que existan varones deben tener la cabeza descubierta salvedad que se hace con militares que disponen de un ceremonial propio uso en el extranjero en el extranjero las embajadas consulados y legaciones oficiales de la secretaria de relaciones exteriores son las encargadas de la vigilancia de la aplicación de la ley y el respeto al himno nacional evitando su uso comercial y autorizando su interpretación previa consulta con la secretaría de gobernación en situaciones que no sean actos cívicos además de promover su interpretación en actos públicos solemnes realizados por mexicanos además tiene la obligación de solicitar ante el gobierno que está acreditado que prohíba su uso sobre todo si es de carácter comercial en otros idiomas en méxico hay personas que conservan y hablan exclusivamente lenguas indígenas o propias de su cultura de origen desde el 8 de diciembre de 2005 el artículo 39 de la ley permite la traducción de la letra a las lenguas nativas la traducción debe ser sancionada por el instituto nacional de lenguas indígenas y autorizada por la secretaría de gobernación hasta 2014 el himno nacional ha sido traducido a las siguientes lenguas indígenas chinanteco otomí mixteco maya náhuatl y huasteco otros grupos nativos han traducido el himno a sus respectivas lenguas pero no ha sido sancionado por el gobierno fuera de las lenguas nativas ha sido traducido al bajo alemán

obligación la enseñanza del himno nacional en todos los planteles de educación prescolar primaria y secundaria en el país para lograr eso desde ese año se organiza un concurso nacional de interpretación del himno por coros infantiles vigilancia en méxico la secretaría de gobernación es la encargada de la vigilancia de la aplicación de la ley aunque se puede ayudar de las demás oficinas del gobierno federal como el caso de la secretaría de relaciones exteriores para otras naciones o la secretaría de educación pública para el caso de la difusión y enseñanza importancia cultural aficionados mexicanos interpretando el himno nacional antes de un partido de fútbol tras la escritura del himno méxico seguía enfrentándose a los efectos de una derrota en una guerra con estados unidos el país se sentía desmoralizado y también dividido debido a la pérdida de aproximadamente la mitad de su territorio el cual le pertenecía ya a estados unidos de acuerdo con el historiador javier garciadiego quien habló en una ceremonia conmemorativa del 150º aniversario de la aprobación del himno en 2004 el himno hace caso omiso a las divisiones y conflictos y anima la unidad nacional en esa misma fecha la ciudad de méxico y otras partes del país detuvieron lo que hacían e interpretaron un canto del himno a nivel nacional individuos de otras naciones participaron también mayoritariamente en las oficinas diplomáticas o en lugares donde se encontraban una alta concentración de expatriados de méxico el himno también ha sido descrito como uno de los símbolos de la identidad mexicana antes de 1820 entre los pueblos prehispánicos no se tiene noticia de que existiera al menos algo parecido a un himno que se identificara unívocamente a algunos de los altépetl pero al llegar las tradiciones europeas tras la llamada conquista española florecieron los llamados himnos religiosos en cuyas letras y música alababan la vida de algún santo o la deidad de la iglesia católica así como los himnos cívicos que trataban de alabar la llegada de virreyes de obispos clérigos la entronización de reyes españoles y más comúnmente la vida de algún personaje o grupo novohispano de entre los autores más destacados de ese tipo de himnos tenemos a manuel de sumaya josé de torres y josé aldana cuya obra religiosa fue profusamente elogiadas en su tiempo y aún hoy destacan de toda su obra los himnos dedicados a la virgen de guadalupe la primera vez que existió en méxico algo muy parecido a un himno nacional fue la llamada marcha real o marcha granadera que desde 1761 se empezó a usar en españa y sus colonias durante las ceremonias cívicas autoría de manuel de espinosa de los monteros fue una obra de cierto agrado que influyo en los años posteriores en el nuevo nacionalismo mexicano que se formó durante la guerra de independencia siglo xix al consumarse la independencia de méxico en 1821 el nuevo nacionalismo mexicano solo impulsó la creación de un escudo y bandera nacional como símbolo del nuevo estado al parecer la idea de un himno nacional no era una necesidad por eso durante la entronización de agustín de iturbide se cantó el himno religioso veni creator en forma especial posteriormente el protocolo de toma del cargo para el primer presidente y vicepresidente de méxico no incluyó ningún himno o canción usada como un himno a pesar de eso durante ese primer medio siglo nunca faltaron propuestas informales de himnos que trataron de tomar el lugar por ejemplo durante la etapa final de la guerra de independencia se realizó un sitio a la ciudad de querétaro por parte de tropas trigarantes entre esas tropas se encontraba un músico llamado josé torrescano quien compuso un himno muy anti español cuya frase más cuestionada era somos independientesviva la libertadviva américa librey viva la igualdad por eso no fue muy promovido el himno ya que la idea del ejército trigarante era lograr la unidad de todos los grupos sociales de la nueva españa ya en lo que se considera el méxico independiente en 1822 otro músico de nombre josé maría garmendía realizó otro himno que no gustó por estar muy centrado en la figura de agustín de iturbide por ejemplo sus primeras palabras eran a las armas valientes indianosa las armas corred con valorel partido seguid de iturbideseamos libres y no haya opresión por eso al cambiar de régimen monárquico a republicano este fue totalmente olvidado luego durante las república tanto federalista como centralista cuando se querían hacer honores al presidente o vicepresidente se interpretaba alguna pieza de su agrado por ejemplo antonio lópez de santa anna gustaba de la obertura semiramis de gioachino rossini mientras josé joaquín de herrera prefería poeta y campesino de franz von suppé el 13 de julio de 1844 otro músico de nombre musicalizó un poema anónimo que honraba a antonio lópez de santa anna quien estaba en su 8º periodo de gobierno durante la república centralista este no gustó al público y terminó olvidado en 1849 luego de la desastrosa guerra mexicanaestadounidense de 1846 a 1848 y durante la presidencia federal de josé joaquín de herrera se formó una llamada junta patriótica de la ciudad de méxico que a través de la academia de san juan de letrán organizó un concurso para buscar una letra que junto a la música del pianista austriaco henri herz pudiera formar un himno nacional ese primer concurso fue la propuesta más seria hasta el momento incluía entre sus jueces a personajes muy destacados de la época como andrés quintana roo manuel lacunza josé joaquín pesado manuel carpio y alejandro arango y escandón el concurso fue ganado por el estadounidense andrés david bradburn lo cual junto con el contenido de la obra hizo que fuera un verdadero fracaso que terminó por olvidarse poco después en 1850 la misma academia de san juan de letrán realizó su propio concurso para musicalizar un poema del cubano juan miguel lozada la música seleccionada fue obra de nicoláscharles bochsa pero al ser un poema muy centrado en la figura del presidente josé joaquín de herrera no trascendió al parecer durante ese año se dio una especie de competencia informal ya que el músico italiano antonio barilli propuso no solo un himno propuso dos los cuales de ninguna manera fueron del agrado del pueblo mexicano poco después en 1851 otro músico de origen checo max maretzek presentó su propuesta y no fructificó y así se fueron acumulando en tan solo tres años varios intentos en abril de 1853 el italiano inocencio pellegrini presentó su canto nacional sin mucho éxito si es que tuvo alguno en diciembre de 1853 otro músico de apellido infante creó una composición patriótica dedicada a antonio lópez de santa anna la cual solo se tocó una noche otras personalidades que presentaron propuestas formales e informales fueron fernando calderón y beltrán josé maría garmendia francisco manuel sánchez de tagle mariano elízaga y josé maría heredia competencia oficial no se sabe si debido a esa efervescencia o solo por el gusto del entonces presidente y dictador antonio lópez de santa anna el 12 de noviembre de 1853 por medio del diario oficial del gobierno de la república mexicana se dio a conocer un doble concurso cuyo fin y orden seria seleccionar un poema patriótico y su musicalización posterior para formar un himno a la patria  en 1854 se celebraría el 25 aniversario de la victoria de tampico de 1829 cuando antonio lópez de santa anna venció al ejército español en su intento de reconquista buscó santa anna festejar por todo lo alto su gran victoria militar donde alcanzó el rango de general de división el concurso se convocó con la anticipación debida para que el 11 de septiembre del siguiente año se tuviera el himno nacional arreglado para la letra se solicitaba enviar la propuesta en sobre cerrado con un seudónimo al ministerio de fomento colonización industria y comercio en menos de veinte días tras lo cual se tardarían diez días para definir al ganador luego de darse a conocer al ganador la musicalización tendría otro mes para recibir propuestas tras lo cual se tardaría un mes más para dar a conocer al ganador de la música en la misma convocatoria se definía que los derechos de explotación de las propuestas pasarían a manos del gobierno central y solo se entregaría una contraprestación a los ganadores esta convocatoria fue firmada por el entonces oficial mayor del ministerio miguel lerdo de tejada el jurado para la letra estuvo formado por josé bernardo couto manuel carpio y josé joaquín pesado mientras el jurado para la música se integró por josé antonio gómez agustín balderas y tomás león el resultado para la letra se publicó el 4 de febrero de 1854 en el diario oficial junto a la letra siendo ganador el potosino francisco gonzález bocanegra quien luego se supiera realizó la letra encerrado en una habitación por la que era entonces su prometida guadalupe gonzález del pino ya que él no quería participar en el concurso gonzález fue anunciado el ganador en el diario oficial del gobierno de la república mexicana del 3 de febrero de 1854 si bien el himno de gonzález bocanegra es un himno de corte bélico no lo es de ataque agresión ó expansionismo sino todo lo contrario es un himno de defensa de la patria y del territorio nacional seguramente inspirado en el evento militar que se recordaba y festejaba ese año de 1854 al cumplirse 25 años de la invasión española de reconquista el poeta narra en sus estrofas la situación y disposición de los mexicanos y la nación ante una invasión extranjera no así para una guerra intestina y fratricida santa anna el gran vencedor de tampico sería recordado en ese himno santanista que incluso le fue obsequiado por gonzález bocanegra en la dedicatoria la misma noche de su estreno en el gran teatro de santa anna el himno reseña una gran victoria militar contra un extraño enemigo es decir una nación extranjera la única gran victoria con esas características que se celebraba en méxico en esa época era la obtenida en tampico en 1829  como decía la convocatoria tras darse a conocer al ganador de la letra se abrió el concurso de la música se realizó como se decía en un mes siendo ganadora la obra del músico italiano giovanni bottesini pero simplemente no gusto además fue acusado de musicalizar y dar a conocer por fuera del concurso su propuesta lo cual era contrario a los términos del concurso debido a eso el concurso se prolongó hasta los ciento ochenta días mientras el 18 de mayo de 1854 estreno formalmente su propuesta en el teatro santa anna con las voces de la soprano enriqueta sontag y el tenor gaspar pozzolini pero aun así no fue del agrado del público en general tras esa prolongación a ciento ochenta días fue la propuesta del músico español jaime nunó roca la que ganó por entonces nunó era director de las bandas militares del ejército nacional ese puesto lo había logrado por invitación de antonio lópez de santa anna quien lo había conocido en uno de sus varios exilios en cuba su obra con el seudónimo dios y libertad fue declarada ganadora el 12 de agosto de 1854 por medio del diario oficial del gobierno de la república mexicana el himno fue aceptado el día de la independencia del mismo año la interpretación inaugural fue dirigida por giovanni bottesini cantado por claudia florenti y lorenzo salvi en el teatro santa anna poco más de un mes después la noche del 15 de septiembre de 1854 fue interpretado públicamente por primera vez el himno en el entonces famoso teatro santa anna que por entonces cerraba al poniente la calle que hoy se llama 5 de mayo en el hoy llamado centro histórico de la ciudad de méxico que en aquella época era lo único que se llamaba ciudad de méxico luego de algunas palabras del poeta francisco gonzález bocanegra se interpretó el himno dirigido por giovanni bottesini y las voces de claudina florentini lorenzo salvi y coros del teatro a cargo de rené masón y pedro carvajal esa primera vez no fue el estreno oficial ya que solo hasta el día siguiente fue cuando antonio lópez de santa anna en su carácter de presidente asistió a su interpretación por parte de balbina steffenone y lorenzo salvi al contrario de todos los intentos anteriores su éxito fue casi inmediato y su partitura se vendió en las calles su rechazo y aceptación pero no duro mucho su fortuna el 9 de agosto de 1855 antonio lópez de santa anna deja la presidencia por última vez y abandona méxico jaime nunó le sigue a la habana y luego se pierde en los eeuu a la vez francisco gonzález bocanegra se esconde en casa de un tío para evitar represalias y no vuelve ponerse a descubierto del público muere de tifo el 11 de abril de 1861 a sus 37 años la causa de ese repentino cambio es por la llamada revolución de ayutla que desde el 1 de marzo de 1854 venia impulsando un cambio de gobierno federalista y liberal por la revolución de ayutla los grupos liberales y federalistas se hacen del poder e inicia la llamada época de la reforma que traería personajes como benito juárez melchor ocampo ignacio ramírez miguel lerdo de tejada guillermo prieto juan n álvarez e ignacio comonfort como eran contrarios a santa anna hicieron lo posible para que se olvidara el himno santanista si bien no lo prohibieron de ninguna manera alentaron su interpretación pero poco a poco el himno fue ganando adeptos por ejemplo al final de la guerra de reforma cuando las tropas federales retomaban la ciudad de méxico el gral liberal florencio maría del castillo relata que la comitiva se detuvo frente al primer arco para escuchar el himno cuya letra sentimos no haber conseguido terminado el himno fue entonada la marsellesa esa marcha que conmueve los corazones de todos los pueblos y la multitud repitió el estribillo de lo anterior se puede ampliar que hasta la llamada segunda intervención francesa el himno más popular en méxico entre los liberales y muchos otros grupos era la marsellesa y que aun durante la guerra en el segundo imperio mexicano era el himno preferido por benito juárez para ser tocado en su presencia como presidente de méxico otro himno muy popular aunque no fue escrito como tal fue obra de guillermo prieto quien la había escrito como poema satírico en 1853 apareció en su libro de 1854 viajes de orden suprema ese poema musicalizado había sido presentado al concurso santanista por guillermo prieto a través de un tercero y titulada la marcha de los cangrejos obviamente no ganó pero para 1864 al inicio del segundo imperio mexicano ya era una de las canciones más populares en méxico al punto de que el propio emperador maximiliano solicitó que se tocara en su presencia durante una visita a la ciudad de guanajuato en 1864 como una manera de congraciarse con los liberales pero el efecto fue un severo susto e indignación de los grupos conservadores y monárquicos que lo apoyaron para llegar al trono de ese himno informal melchor ocampo cuenta que los cangrejos convertidos en himno popular formulaban el regocijo y el orden y la concordia embellecían un día que lo sobreponen en grandeza a la recepción del ejército trigarantesic otra obra que llegó a ser muy popular y usada como himno fue adiós mamá carlota que solo por su letra no terminó por oficializarse en todo caso al final de la guerra y con la república restaurada el himno santanista volvió a tener presencia si no es que la tuvo durante toda la guerra aunque con varias modificaciones por ejemplo en 1864 el presidente benito juárez discutió con varios sobre ciertas modificaciones a la letra le sugerían suprimir la referencia al guerrero inmortal de zempoala a lo que contesto al himno nacional no se le quita ni una sola nota ni una sola palabra otro cambio que sí perduró fue en la séptima estrofa cambiando si a la lid contra estado enemigo por si a la lid contra hueste enemiga además de muchas otras que no perduraron tras esa época llegó la presidencia de sebastián lerdo de tejada hermano de quien siendo oficial mayor firmó la convocatoria al concurso de 1853 al parecer desde ese momento se impulsó el uso del himno santanista aunque con modificaciones tras la caída de su gobierno por el plan de tuxtepec el nuevo presidente porfirio díaz empezó a usar el himno santanista de común para las ceremonias oficiales siglo xx en 1901 es redescubierto por decirlo de alguna manera el compositor jaime nunó un grupo de mexicanos que estaban de viaje por estados unidos lo encuentra en la ciudad de buffalo nueva york lo dan a conocer al presidente y este lo invita a visitar méxico acepta y durante su visita por primera vez dirige orquesta y coros para interpretar el himno mexicano pero su visita no resulta cálida y regresa a nueva york para entonces era ciudadano estadounidense en 1904 vuelve a ser invitado con motivo de los cincuenta años del himno con mucho más éxito que la visita anterior esa fue la última vez que vivo tocó suelo mexicano ya que muere el 18 de julio de 1908 en bay city nueva jersey durante su primera visita el 11 de febrero de 1901 tras una sesión solemne se anunció que el congreso de la unión concedía a jaime nunó y gonzález bocanegra la cantidad de dos mil pesos de entonces como contraprestación y premio por el concurso de 1853 por parte de gonzález bocanegra el dinero fue recibido por mercedes serralde de gonzález bocanegra como heredera del poeta además a nunó se le dieron los 388 pesos que puso de su bolsillo para hacer la primera tirada de la partitura en 1854 lo cual él ratificó en una entrevista al diario el imparcial del 9 de julio de 1901 durante las celebraciones del centenario de la independencia se vuelve normal el uso del himno santanista y se le empieza a llamar corrientemente como himno nacional méxicano durante la revolución mexicana ya tiene el sello de aprobación popular y oficial pero sin una reglamentación clara se interpreta con las estrofas a gusto del intérprete aunque algunas ya se destacan entre las diez cuatro de ellas en concreto para la llamada guerra cristera incluso se usa por parte del gobierno anticlerical la segunda estrofa que dice de la paz el arcángel divinoque en el cielo tu eterno destinopor el dedo de dios se escribió la primera vez que se grabó el himno en un medio sonoro fue el 28 de julio de 1922 por la cantante duranguense fanny anitúa su versión al decir de muchos fue deficiente y modificada lo que causó gran polémica al grado de requerir una revisión oficial por parte del consejo cultural del distrito federal la revisión fue llevada a cabo por josé lópez portillo y rojas manuel barajas y julián carrillo durante esta revisión se conoció la pérdida de los textos originales entonces el grupo recurrió a la familia de gonzález bocanegra quienes entregaron originales del estribillo y las estrofas también se consiguió una primera edición del himno bajo el sello de la casa murguía en 1854 por otra parte una de las familias pudientes de la época identificada como pérez salas obsequió una instrumentación del himno que el mismo jaime nunó envió a la plana mayor del ejército nacional y a la dirección general de artillería uno de los que pagó con 388 pesos esa revisión demostró los varios cambios que había sufrido el himno así como la dificultad de interpretarlo completo por eso se empezó a limitar el número de estrofas pero sin seguir una formalidad por eso el 4 de mayo de 1943 el entonces presidente de méxico manuel ávila camacho durante la participación de méxico en la segunda guerra mundial promulgó un decreto que oficializaba el himno y lo limitaba a las estrofas i v vi y x más el estribillo por ese decreto se prohibió alterar corregir o modificar la letra o la música ese decreto se formalizó aún más y conjugó con los otros símbolos patrios el 23 de diciembre de 1967 por la ley sobre las características y el uso del escudo la bandera y el himno nacionales ley que fue suprimida en 1984 por la ley sobre el escudo la bandera y el himno nacionales la cual es el ordenamiento que la rige hasta hoy controversias derechos de autor en 1959 la sociedad repertorio wagner s a publicó una partitura para que se pudiera interpretar el himno nacional mexicano por parte de las bandas civiles de música el decreto de 1943 no tenía una partitura anexa y debía conseguirse aparte además de que no era fácil duplicar el decreto esa publicación levantó varios gritos de histeria y terror entre el pueblo mexicano ya que varios periódicos difundieron la supuesta noticia de que wagner era propietaria o se hacía pasar por propietaria del himno nacional debido a eso por ejemplo se dijo que cada lunes los estudiantes debían dar un peso a su escuela para poder interpretar el himno lo que a todas luces es falso de esta manera durante toda su vida el himno ha estado por decirlo ligeramente lleno de bromas de mal gusto incluso en la era del internet como ejemplo de ello está el rumor de que la casa wagner y levien registró el himno nacional mexicano y que por eso cobraba los derechos de ejecución declarándose propietaria de la obra a nivel internacional situación similar pasa en los eeuu con la casa ralph s perr y compañía pero por más desmentido oficial que hace el gobierno mexicano aún sigue el mito en septiembre de 1959 luego de poner una multa a la casa wagner se realizó una investigación para dilucidar si el rumor de que la familia de jaime nunó había vendido los derechos del autor a una casa musical en los eeuu de la investigación se determinó que no existió tal venta de sus derechos de explotación y menos sus derechos de autor aunque luego se encontró que el mismo jaime nunó había vendido en la década de 1850 sus derechos de explotación efectivamente a una casa de música estadounidense pero solo de un arreglo a la música del himno un arreglo para tocar el himno al piano ese arreglo además estaba en otro ritmo y tenor por lo que era muy diferente a la versión original además para 1960 ya habían pasado los cien años que protegía la legislación estadounidense los derechos de explotación y por la misma legislación al ser una obra anterior a 1909 no le aplicaba la ley vigente en 1953 antes de 1909 no existía ley en eeuu que protegiera eso en último caso no transcendía su ley fuera de sus fronteras otra versión de la venta de los derechos de jaime nunó es como sigue el propio nunó y dos estadounidenses harry henneman y phil hill registraron la música de nuñó con la empresa bmi edward b marks music company fue entonces la editora del himno en los eeuu en 1910 y 1911 por lo que luego de encontrarse con las publicaciones de esa casa editorial varios mexicanos empezaron a propagar el rumor sobre que esa casa comercial era la dueña de los derechos de autor no obstante la ley de los derechos de autor en estados unidos declara que el himno mexicano está en el dominio público dentro de los estados unidos dado que tanto la letra como la música fueron estrenadas antes de 1909 además bajo la ley de derechos de autor en méxico el artículo 155 expone que el gobierno tiene los derechos morales pero no el derecho de autor del himno además de que también en méxico está en dominio público ya que se cumplieron los cien años establecidos para su liberación desde el 2008 himno bélico otra polémica muy habitual se basa en que la letra del himno es muy bélica por ejemplo se dice que el estribillo llama a la guerra mexicanos al grito de guerra por lo que varias veces se ha propuesto modificar o cambiar de plano el himno incluso en tiempos recientes el poeta javier sicilia en una entrevista sobre la caravana con justicia y dignidad a la pregunta de también lo preguntaba por el lábaro patrio porque he visto que te molesta el belicismo del himno nacional de méxico respondió sicilia cuando han intentado cantar el himno en el templete de las caravanas yo digo no habría que cambiarlo si lo escuchamos es el problema de no atender a las palabras el himno justifica la guerra necesitamos cambiar la letra esa letra no nos representa fue de un momento histórico y no es el que vivimos estamos en la búsqueda de la paz del amor del reconocimiento de lo humano por encima de las fronteras y nacionessic esa polémica básicamente se ve en personajes de la izquierda mexicana como lo es sicilia es un himno de la derecha en forma paralela sobre el tema belicista del himno esta la polémica sobre su origen santanista ya que antonio lópez de santa anna es uno si no el más odiado personaje de la historia mexicana sobre todo se recuerda su participación en la guerra mexicanaestadounidense y en la guerra texana los principales defensores de esta polémica están en la llamada izquierda mientras los llamados políticos de derecha normalmente defienden el himno como una obra propia de su tiempo que ha ganado su lugar en la historia y estima del pueblo como refuerzo del rechazo al himno se marca su estilo musical conocido como quinta real por su parecido con la marcha real una marcha militar que desde 1791 se usa como himno de españa cine en 1943 cuando se oficializó el himno se estrenó la película mexicanos al grito de guerra dirigida por álvaro gálvez y fuentes e ismael rodríguez y protagonizada por pedro infante y lina montes cuya trama básica es la supuesta historia del himno nacional hasta la batalla del 5 de mayo en puebla en la parte final se muestra a los soldados mexicanos cantando el himno para darse valor pero ningún documento histórico ha podido respaldar esa escena el segundo durante décadas se ha dicho e incluso medios de comunicación han informado que el himno nacional mexicano es considerado el segundo más bello del mundo detrás de la marsellesa pero hasta el día de hoy no se ha llevado a cabo ningún tipo de concurso o competición arbitrada que avale ese dicho incluso es común oír este mito aplicado a otros himnos nacionales como por ejemplo el ecuatoriano colombiano peruano inglés estadounidense etc

lid conquistar tornaránse sus lauros sangrientos en guirnaldas de mirtos y rosas que el amor de las hijas y esposas también sabe a los bravos premiar ix y el que al golpe de ardiente metralla de la patria en las aras sucumba obtendrá en recompensa una tumba donde brille de gloria la luz y de iguala la enseña querida a su espada sangrienta enlazada de laurel inmortal coronada formará de su fosa una cruz x patria patria tus hijos te juran exhalar en tus aras su aliento si el clarín con su bélico acento los convoca a lidiar con valor para ti las guirnaldas de oliva un recuerdo para ellos de

francisco gonzález bocanegra en 1853 mientras que su música obra del músico español jaime nunó fue compuesta al año siguiente en su versión original el himno está compuesto por diez estrofas pero en los noventa años que pasó para su oficialización pasó por varias modificaciones o intentos de modificación quedando reducido solo a cuatro estrofas y el estribillo a partir de 1943 cuando fue

guirnaldas de oliva un recuerdo para ellos de gloria un laurel para ti de victoria un sepulcro para ellos de honor oficialmente en 1943 el texto del himno nacional fue completamente publicado con sus diez estrofas y estribillo pero algunas se recortaron porque hacían referencia a santa anna por eso se recortó a solo cuatro estrofas que son las estrofas i v vi y x de la versión original y el estribillo la modificación de la letra fue ordenada primero por el presidente manuel ávila camacho pero solo se oficializó en 1984 por el presidente miguel de la madrid hurtado a las cuatro estrofas

el himno nacional y otro extranjero se ejecutará en primer lugar el mexicano pero si existe un protocolo como en los juegos olímpicos se interpretará de acuerdo al orden que marque el protocolo correspondiente de ese acto por otro lado su uso como distintivo de honor se ejecuta acompañado de otra música por ejemplo para hacer honores al presidente de la república las bandas militares presentes tocarán la marcha de honor el caso de honores a la bandera las bandas de música ejecutarán el himno y a la vez las bandas militares tocarán la marcha llamada bandera y establece un límite a sus interpretaciones en ese caso dos veces para hacer honores a la bandera y rendir honores al presidente de la república aunque se indica la salvedad de que cuando sea interpretado por un coro las bandas militares deberán permanecer en silencio para apagar al coro en cualquier caso los presentes deberán demostrar el respecto asumiendo la posición de firme y en caso de que existan varones deben

aficionados mexicanos interpretando el himno nacional antes de un partido de fútbol tras la escritura del himno méxico seguía enfrentándose a los efectos de una derrota en una guerra con estados unidos el país se sentía desmoralizado y también dividido debido a la pérdida de aproximadamente la mitad de su territorio el cual le pertenecía ya a estados unidos de acuerdo con el historiador javier garciadiego quien habló en una ceremonia conmemorativa del 150º aniversario de la aprobación del himno en 2004 el himno hace caso omiso a las divisiones y conflictos y anima la unidad nacional en esa misma fecha la ciudad de méxico y otras partes del país detuvieron lo que hacían e interpretaron un canto del himno a nivel nacional individuos de otras naciones participaron también mayoritariamente en las oficinas diplomáticas o en lugares donde se encontraban una alta concentración de expatriados de méxico el himno también ha sido descrito como uno de los símbolos de la identidad mexicana antes de 1820 entre los pueblos prehispánicos no se tiene noticia de que existiera al menos algo parecido a un himno que se identificara unívocamente a algunos de los altépetl pero al llegar las tradiciones europeas tras la llamada conquista española florecieron los llamados himnos religiosos en cuyas letras y música alababan la vida de algún santo o la deidad de la iglesia católica así como los himnos cívicos que trataban de alabar la llegada de virreyes de obispos clérigos la entronización de reyes españoles y más comúnmente la vida de algún personaje o grupo novohispano de entre los autores más destacados de ese tipo de himnos tenemos a manuel de sumaya josé de torres y josé aldana cuya obra religiosa fue profusamente elogiadas en su tiempo y aún hoy destacan de toda su obra los himnos dedicados a la virgen de guadalupe la primera vez que existió en méxico algo muy parecido a un himno nacional fue la llamada marcha real o marcha granadera que desde 1761 se empezó a usar en españa y sus colonias durante las ceremonias cívicas autoría de manuel de espinosa de los monteros fue una obra de cierto agrado que influyo en los años posteriores en el nuevo nacionalismo mexicano que se formó durante la guerra de independencia siglo xix al consumarse la independencia de méxico en 1821 el nuevo nacionalismo mexicano solo impulsó la creación de un escudo y bandera nacional como símbolo del nuevo estado al parecer la idea de un himno nacional no era una necesidad por eso durante la entronización de agustín de iturbide se cantó el himno religioso veni creator en forma especial posteriormente el protocolo de toma del cargo para el primer presidente y vicepresidente de méxico no incluyó ningún himno o canción usada como un himno a pesar de eso durante ese primer medio siglo nunca faltaron propuestas informales de himnos que trataron de tomar el lugar por ejemplo durante la etapa final de la guerra de independencia se realizó un sitio a la ciudad de querétaro por parte de tropas trigarantes entre esas tropas se encontraba un músico llamado josé torrescano quien compuso un himno muy anti español cuya frase más cuestionada era somos independientesviva la libertadviva américa librey viva la igualdad por eso no fue muy promovido el himno ya que la idea del ejército trigarante era lograr la unidad de todos los grupos sociales de la nueva españa ya en lo que se considera el méxico independiente en 1822 otro músico de nombre josé maría garmendía realizó otro himno que no gustó por estar muy centrado en la figura de agustín de iturbide por ejemplo sus primeras palabras eran a las armas valientes indianosa las armas corred con valorel partido seguid de iturbideseamos libres y no haya opresión por eso al cambiar de régimen monárquico a republicano este fue totalmente olvidado luego durante las república tanto federalista como centralista cuando se querían hacer honores al presidente o vicepresidente se interpretaba alguna pieza de su agrado por ejemplo antonio lópez de santa anna gustaba de la obertura semiramis de gioachino rossini mientras josé joaquín de herrera prefería poeta y campesino de franz von suppé el 13 de julio de 1844 otro músico de nombre musicalizó un poema anónimo que honraba a antonio lópez de santa anna quien estaba en su 8º periodo de gobierno durante la república centralista este no gustó al público y terminó olvidado en 1849 luego de la desastrosa guerra mexicanaestadounidense de 1846 a 1848 y durante la presidencia federal de josé joaquín de herrera se formó una llamada junta patriótica de la ciudad de méxico que a través de la academia de san juan de letrán organizó un concurso para buscar una letra que junto a la música del pianista austriaco henri herz pudiera formar un himno nacional ese primer concurso fue la propuesta más seria hasta el momento incluía entre sus jueces a personajes muy destacados de la época como andrés quintana roo manuel lacunza josé joaquín pesado manuel carpio y alejandro arango y escandón el concurso fue ganado por el estadounidense andrés david bradburn lo cual junto con el contenido de la obra hizo que fuera un verdadero fracaso que terminó por olvidarse poco después en 1850 la misma academia de san juan de letrán realizó su propio concurso para musicalizar un poema del cubano juan miguel lozada la música seleccionada fue obra de nicoláscharles bochsa pero al ser un poema muy centrado en la figura del presidente josé joaquín de herrera no trascendió al parecer durante ese año se dio una especie de competencia informal ya que el músico italiano antonio barilli propuso no solo un himno propuso dos los cuales de ninguna manera fueron del agrado del pueblo mexicano poco después en 1851 otro músico de origen checo max maretzek presentó su propuesta y no fructificó y así se fueron acumulando en tan solo tres años varios intentos en abril de 1853 el italiano inocencio pellegrini presentó su canto nacional sin mucho éxito si es que tuvo alguno en diciembre de 1853 otro músico de apellido infante creó una composición patriótica dedicada a antonio lópez de santa anna la cual solo se tocó una noche otras personalidades que presentaron propuestas formales e informales fueron fernando calderón y beltrán josé maría garmendia francisco manuel sánchez de tagle mariano elízaga y josé maría heredia competencia oficial no se sabe si debido a esa efervescencia o solo por el gusto del entonces presidente y dictador antonio lópez de santa anna el 12 de noviembre de 1853 por medio del diario oficial del gobierno de la república mexicana se dio a conocer un doble concurso cuyo fin y orden seria seleccionar un poema patriótico y su musicalización posterior para formar un himno a la patria  en 1854 se celebraría el 25 aniversario de la victoria de tampico de 1829 cuando antonio lópez de santa anna venció al ejército español en su intento de reconquista buscó santa anna festejar por todo lo alto su gran victoria militar donde alcanzó el rango de general de división el concurso se convocó con la anticipación debida para que el 11 de septiembre del siguiente año se tuviera el himno nacional arreglado para la letra se solicitaba enviar la propuesta en sobre cerrado con un seudónimo al ministerio de fomento colonización industria y comercio en menos de veinte días tras lo cual se tardarían diez días para definir al ganador luego de darse a conocer al ganador la musicalización tendría otro mes para recibir propuestas tras lo cual se tardaría un mes más para dar a conocer al ganador de la música en la misma convocatoria se definía que los derechos de explotación de las propuestas pasarían a manos del gobierno central y solo se entregaría una contraprestación a los ganadores esta convocatoria fue firmada por el entonces oficial mayor del ministerio miguel lerdo de tejada el jurado para la letra estuvo formado por josé bernardo couto manuel carpio y josé joaquín pesado mientras el jurado para la música se integró por josé antonio gómez agustín balderas y tomás león el resultado para la letra se publicó el 4 de febrero de 1854 en el diario oficial junto a la letra siendo ganador el potosino francisco gonzález bocanegra quien luego se supiera realizó la letra encerrado en una habitación por la que era entonces su prometida guadalupe gonzález del pino ya que él no quería participar en el concurso gonzález fue anunciado el ganador en el diario oficial del gobierno de la república mexicana del 3 de febrero de 1854 si bien el himno de gonzález bocanegra es un himno de corte bélico no lo es de ataque agresión ó expansionismo sino todo lo contrario es un himno de defensa de la patria y del territorio nacional seguramente inspirado en el evento militar que se recordaba y festejaba ese año de 1854 al cumplirse 25 años de la invasión española de reconquista el poeta narra en sus estrofas la situación y disposición de los mexicanos y la nación ante una invasión extranjera no así para una guerra intestina y fratricida santa anna el gran vencedor de tampico sería recordado en ese himno santanista que incluso le fue obsequiado por gonzález bocanegra en la dedicatoria la misma noche de su estreno en el gran teatro de santa anna el himno reseña una gran victoria militar contra un extraño enemigo es decir una nación extranjera la única gran victoria con esas características que se celebraba en méxico en esa época era la obtenida en tampico en 1829  como decía la convocatoria tras darse a conocer al ganador de la letra se abrió el concurso de la música se realizó como se decía en un mes siendo ganadora la obra del músico italiano giovanni bottesini pero simplemente no gusto además fue acusado de musicalizar y dar a conocer por fuera del concurso su propuesta lo cual era contrario a los términos del concurso debido a eso el concurso se prolongó hasta los ciento ochenta días mientras el 18 de mayo de 1854 estreno formalmente su propuesta en el teatro santa anna con las voces de la soprano enriqueta sontag y el tenor gaspar pozzolini pero aun así no fue del agrado del público en general tras esa prolongación a ciento ochenta días fue la propuesta del músico español jaime nunó roca la que ganó por entonces nunó era director de las bandas militares del ejército nacional ese puesto lo había logrado por invitación de antonio lópez de santa anna quien lo había conocido en uno de sus varios exilios en cuba su obra con el seudónimo dios y libertad fue declarada ganadora el 12 de agosto de 1854 por medio del diario oficial del gobierno de la república mexicana el himno fue aceptado el día de la independencia del mismo año la interpretación inaugural fue dirigida por giovanni bottesini cantado por claudia florenti y lorenzo salvi en el teatro santa anna poco más de un mes después la noche del 15 de septiembre de 1854 fue interpretado públicamente por primera vez el himno en el entonces famoso teatro santa anna que por entonces cerraba al poniente la calle que hoy se llama 5 de mayo en el hoy llamado centro histórico de la ciudad de méxico que en aquella época era lo único que se llamaba ciudad de méxico luego de algunas palabras del poeta francisco gonzález bocanegra se interpretó el himno dirigido por giovanni bottesini y las voces de claudina florentini lorenzo salvi y coros del teatro a cargo de rené masón y pedro carvajal esa primera vez no fue el estreno oficial ya que solo hasta el día siguiente fue cuando antonio lópez de santa anna en su carácter de presidente asistió a su interpretación por parte de balbina steffenone y lorenzo salvi al contrario de todos los intentos anteriores su éxito fue casi inmediato y su partitura se vendió en las calles su rechazo y aceptación pero no duro mucho su fortuna el 9 de agosto de 1855 antonio lópez de santa anna deja la presidencia por última vez y abandona méxico jaime nunó le sigue a la habana y luego se pierde en los eeuu a la vez francisco gonzález bocanegra se esconde en casa de un tío para evitar represalias y no vuelve ponerse a descubierto del público muere de tifo el 11 de abril de 1861 a sus 37 años la causa de ese repentino cambio es por la llamada revolución de ayutla que desde el 1 de marzo de 1854 venia impulsando un cambio de gobierno federalista y liberal por la revolución de ayutla los grupos liberales y federalistas se hacen del poder e inicia la llamada época de la reforma que traería personajes como benito juárez melchor ocampo ignacio ramírez miguel lerdo de tejada guillermo prieto juan n álvarez e ignacio comonfort como eran contrarios a santa anna hicieron lo posible para que se olvidara el himno santanista si bien no lo prohibieron de ninguna manera alentaron su interpretación pero poco a poco el himno fue ganando adeptos por ejemplo al final de la guerra de reforma cuando las tropas federales retomaban la ciudad de méxico el gral liberal florencio maría del castillo relata que la comitiva se detuvo frente al primer arco para escuchar el himno cuya letra sentimos no haber conseguido terminado el himno fue entonada la marsellesa esa marcha que conmueve los corazones de todos los pueblos y la multitud repitió el estribillo de lo anterior se puede ampliar que hasta la llamada segunda intervención francesa el himno más popular en méxico entre los liberales y muchos otros grupos era la marsellesa y que aun durante la guerra en el segundo imperio mexicano era el himno preferido por benito juárez para ser tocado en su presencia como presidente de méxico otro himno muy popular aunque no fue escrito como tal fue obra de guillermo prieto quien la había escrito como poema satírico en 1853 apareció en su libro de 1854 viajes de orden suprema ese poema musicalizado había sido presentado al concurso santanista por guillermo prieto a través de un tercero y titulada la marcha de los cangrejos obviamente no ganó pero para 1864 al inicio del segundo imperio mexicano ya era una de las canciones más populares en méxico al punto de que el propio emperador maximiliano solicitó que se tocara en su presencia durante una visita a la ciudad de guanajuato en 1864 como una manera de congraciarse con los liberales pero el efecto fue un severo susto e indignación de los grupos conservadores y monárquicos que lo apoyaron para llegar al trono de ese himno informal melchor ocampo cuenta que los cangrejos convertidos en himno popular formulaban el regocijo y el orden y la concordia embellecían un día que lo sobreponen en grandeza a la recepción del ejército trigarantesic otra obra que llegó a ser muy popular y usada como himno fue adiós mamá carlota que solo por su letra no terminó por oficializarse en todo caso al final de la guerra y con la república restaurada el himno santanista volvió a tener presencia si no es que la tuvo durante toda la guerra aunque con varias modificaciones por ejemplo en 1864 el presidente benito juárez discutió con varios sobre ciertas modificaciones a la letra le sugerían suprimir la referencia al guerrero inmortal de zempoala a lo que contesto al himno nacional no se le quita ni una sola nota ni una sola palabra otro cambio que sí perduró fue en la séptima estrofa cambiando si a la lid contra estado enemigo por si a la lid contra hueste enemiga además de muchas otras que no perduraron tras esa época llegó la presidencia de sebastián lerdo de tejada hermano de quien siendo oficial mayor firmó la convocatoria al concurso de 1853 al parecer desde ese momento se impulsó el uso del himno santanista aunque con modificaciones tras la caída de su gobierno por el plan de tuxtepec el nuevo presidente porfirio díaz empezó a usar el himno santanista de común para las ceremonias oficiales siglo xx en 1901 es redescubierto por decirlo de alguna manera el compositor jaime nunó un grupo de mexicanos que estaban de viaje por estados unidos lo encuentra en la ciudad de buffalo nueva york lo dan a conocer al presidente y este lo invita a visitar méxico acepta y durante su visita por primera vez dirige orquesta y coros para interpretar el himno mexicano pero su visita no resulta cálida y regresa a nueva york para entonces era ciudadano estadounidense en 1904 vuelve a ser invitado con motivo de los cincuenta años del himno con mucho más éxito que la visita anterior esa fue la última vez que vivo tocó suelo mexicano ya que muere el 18 de julio de 1908 en bay city nueva jersey durante su primera visita el 11 de febrero de 1901 tras una sesión solemne se anunció que el congreso de la unión concedía a jaime nunó y gonzález bocanegra la cantidad de dos mil pesos de entonces como contraprestación y premio por el concurso de 1853 por parte de gonzález bocanegra el dinero fue recibido por mercedes serralde de gonzález bocanegra como heredera del poeta además a nunó se le dieron los 388 pesos que puso de su bolsillo para hacer la primera tirada de la partitura en 1854 lo cual él ratificó en una entrevista al diario el imparcial del 9 de julio de 1901 durante las celebraciones del centenario de la independencia se vuelve normal el uso del himno santanista y se le empieza a llamar corrientemente como himno nacional méxicano durante la revolución mexicana ya tiene el sello de aprobación popular y oficial pero sin una reglamentación clara se interpreta con las estrofas a gusto del intérprete aunque algunas ya se destacan entre las diez cuatro de ellas en concreto para la llamada guerra cristera incluso se usa por parte del gobierno anticlerical la segunda estrofa que dice de la paz el arcángel divinoque en el cielo tu eterno destinopor el dedo de dios se escribió la primera vez que se grabó el himno en un medio sonoro fue el 28 de julio de 1922 por la cantante duranguense fanny anitúa su versión al decir de muchos fue deficiente y modificada lo que causó gran polémica al grado de requerir una revisión oficial por parte del consejo cultural del distrito federal la revisión fue llevada a cabo por josé lópez portillo y rojas manuel barajas y julián carrillo durante esta revisión se conoció la pérdida de los textos originales entonces el grupo recurrió a la familia de gonzález bocanegra quienes entregaron originales del estribillo y las estrofas también se consiguió una primera edición del himno bajo el sello de la casa murguía en 1854 por otra parte una de las familias pudientes de la época identificada como pérez salas obsequió una instrumentación del himno que el mismo jaime nunó envió a la plana mayor del ejército nacional y a la dirección general de artillería uno de los que pagó con 388 pesos esa revisión demostró los varios cambios que había sufrido el himno así como la dificultad de interpretarlo completo por eso se empezó a limitar el número de estrofas pero sin seguir una formalidad por eso el 4 de mayo de 1943 el entonces presidente de méxico manuel ávila camacho durante la participación de méxico en la segunda guerra mundial promulgó un decreto que oficializaba el himno y lo limitaba a las estrofas i v vi y x más el estribillo por ese decreto se prohibió alterar corregir o modificar la letra o la música ese decreto se formalizó aún más y conjugó con los otros símbolos patrios el 23 de diciembre de 1967 por la ley sobre las características y el uso del escudo la bandera y el himno nacionales ley que fue suprimida en 1984 por la ley sobre el escudo la bandera y el himno nacionales la cual es el ordenamiento que la rige hasta hoy controversias derechos de autor en 1959 la sociedad repertorio wagner s a publicó una partitura para que se pudiera interpretar el himno nacional mexicano por parte de las bandas civiles de música el decreto de 1943 no tenía una partitura anexa y debía conseguirse aparte además de que no era fácil duplicar el decreto esa publicación levantó varios gritos de histeria y terror entre el pueblo mexicano ya que varios periódicos difundieron la supuesta noticia de que wagner era propietaria o se hacía pasar por propietaria del himno nacional debido a eso por ejemplo se dijo que cada lunes los estudiantes debían dar un peso a su escuela para poder interpretar el himno lo que a todas luces es falso de esta manera durante toda su vida el himno ha estado por decirlo ligeramente lleno de bromas de mal gusto incluso en la era del internet como ejemplo de ello está el rumor de que la casa wagner y levien registró el himno nacional mexicano y que por eso cobraba los derechos de ejecución declarándose propietaria de la obra a nivel internacional situación similar pasa en los eeuu con la casa ralph s perr y compañía pero por más desmentido oficial que hace el gobierno mexicano aún sigue el mito en septiembre de 1959 luego de poner una multa a la casa wagner se realizó una investigación para dilucidar si el rumor de que la familia de jaime nunó había vendido los derechos del autor a una casa musical en los eeuu de la investigación se determinó que no existió tal venta de sus derechos de explotación y menos sus derechos de autor aunque luego se encontró que el mismo jaime nunó había vendido en la década de 1850 sus derechos de explotación efectivamente a una casa de música estadounidense pero solo de un arreglo a la música del himno un arreglo para tocar el himno al piano ese arreglo además estaba en otro ritmo y tenor por lo que era muy diferente a la versión original además para 1960 ya habían pasado los cien años que protegía la legislación estadounidense los derechos de explotación y por la misma legislación al ser una obra anterior a 1909 no le aplicaba la ley vigente en 1953 antes de 1909 no existía ley en eeuu que protegiera eso en último caso no transcendía su ley fuera de sus fronteras otra versión de la venta de los derechos de jaime nunó es como sigue el propio nunó y dos estadounidenses harry henneman y phil hill registraron la música de nuñó con la empresa bmi edward b marks music company fue entonces la editora del himno en los eeuu en 1910 y 1911 por lo que luego de encontrarse con las publicaciones de esa casa editorial varios mexicanos empezaron a propagar el rumor sobre que esa casa comercial era la dueña de los derechos de autor no obstante la ley de los derechos de autor en estados unidos declara que el himno mexicano está en el dominio público dentro de los estados unidos dado que tanto la letra como la música fueron estrenadas antes de 1909 además bajo la ley de derechos de autor en méxico el artículo 155 expone que el gobierno tiene los derechos morales pero no el derecho de autor del himno además de que también en méxico está en dominio público ya que se cumplieron los cien años establecidos para su liberación desde el 2008 himno bélico otra polémica muy habitual se basa en que la letra del himno es muy bélica por ejemplo se dice que el estribillo llama a la guerra mexicanos al grito de guerra por lo que varias veces se ha propuesto modificar o cambiar de plano el himno incluso en tiempos recientes el poeta javier sicilia en una entrevista sobre la caravana con justicia y dignidad a la pregunta de también lo preguntaba por el lábaro patrio porque he visto que te molesta el belicismo del himno nacional de méxico respondió sicilia cuando han intentado cantar el himno en el templete de las caravanas yo digo no habría que cambiarlo si lo escuchamos es el problema de no atender a las palabras el himno justifica la guerra necesitamos cambiar la letra esa letra no nos representa fue de un momento histórico y no es el que vivimos estamos en la búsqueda de la paz del amor del reconocimiento de lo humano por encima de las fronteras y nacionessic esa polémica básicamente se ve en personajes de la izquierda mexicana como lo es sicilia es un himno de la derecha en forma paralela sobre el tema belicista del himno esta la polémica sobre su origen santanista ya que antonio lópez de santa anna es uno si no el más odiado personaje de la historia mexicana sobre todo se recuerda su participación en la guerra mexicanaestadounidense y en la guerra texana los principales defensores de esta polémica están en la llamada izquierda mientras los llamados políticos de derecha normalmente defienden el himno como una obra propia de su tiempo que ha ganado su lugar en la historia y estima del pueblo como refuerzo del rechazo al himno se marca su estilo musical conocido como quinta real por su parecido con la marcha real una marcha militar que desde 1791 se usa como himno de españa cine en 1943 cuando se oficializó el himno se estrenó la película mexicanos al grito de guerra dirigida por álvaro gálvez y fuentes e ismael rodríguez y protagonizada por pedro infante y lina montes cuya trama básica es la supuesta historia del himno nacional hasta la batalla del 5 de mayo en puebla en la parte final se muestra a los soldados mexicanos cantando el himno para darse valor pero ningún documento histórico ha podido respaldar esa escena el segundo durante décadas se ha dicho e incluso medios de comunicación han informado que el himno nacional mexicano es considerado el segundo más bello del mundo detrás de la marsellesa pero hasta el día de hoy no se ha llevado a cabo ningún tipo de concurso o competición arbitrada que avale ese dicho incluso es común oír este mito aplicado a otros himnos nacionales como por ejemplo el ecuatoriano colombiano peruano inglés estadounidense etc

versiones completas que se producen durante ceremonias oficiales en ceremonias oficiales en territorio mexicano de instituciones públicas y privadas donde deba tocarse el himno nacional y otro extranjero se ejecutará en primer lugar el mexicano pero si existe un protocolo como en los juegos olímpicos se interpretará de acuerdo al orden que marque el protocolo correspondiente de ese acto por otro lado su uso como distintivo de honor se ejecuta acompañado de otra música por ejemplo para hacer honores al presidente de la república las bandas militares presentes tocarán la marcha de honor el caso de honores a la bandera las bandas de música ejecutarán el himno y a la vez las bandas militares tocarán la marcha llamada bandera y establece un límite a sus interpretaciones en ese caso dos veces para hacer honores a la bandera y rendir honores al presidente de la república aunque se indica la salvedad de que cuando sea interpretado por un coro las bandas militares deberán permanecer en silencio para apagar al coro en cualquier caso los presentes deberán demostrar el respecto asumiendo la posición de firme y en caso de que existan varones deben tener la cabeza descubierta salvedad que se hace con militares que disponen de un ceremonial propio uso en el extranjero en el extranjero las embajadas consulados y legaciones oficiales de la secretaria de relaciones exteriores son las encargadas de la vigilancia de la aplicación de la ley y el respeto al himno nacional evitando su uso comercial y autorizando su interpretación previa consulta con la secretaría de gobernación en situaciones que no sean actos cívicos además de promover su interpretación en actos públicos solemnes realizados por mexicanos además tiene la obligación de solicitar ante el gobierno que está acreditado que prohíba su uso sobre todo si es de carácter comercial en otros idiomas en méxico hay personas que conservan y hablan exclusivamente lenguas indígenas o propias de su cultura de origen desde el 8 de diciembre de 2005 el artículo 39 de la ley permite la traducción de la letra a las lenguas nativas la traducción debe ser sancionada por el instituto nacional de lenguas indígenas y autorizada por la secretaría de gobernación hasta 2014 el himno nacional ha sido traducido a las siguientes lenguas indígenas chinanteco otomí mixteco maya náhuatl y huasteco otros grupos nativos han traducido el himno a sus respectivas lenguas pero no ha sido sancionado por el gobierno fuera de las lenguas nativas ha sido traducido al bajo alemán plautdietsch niños y jóvenes menonitas de méxico entonan el himno nacional mexicano traducido al alemán dentro de sus colegios cada lunes en 2008 resultó ganador a nivel estatal un colegio menonita llamado la esperanza del municipio chihuahuense de cuauhtémoc quienes entonaron el himno nacional mexicano en español y una estrofa en su idioma materno enseñanza y difusión desde 2005 es una obligación la enseñanza del himno nacional en todos los planteles de educación prescolar primaria y secundaria en el país para lograr eso desde ese año se organiza un concurso nacional de interpretación del himno por coros infantiles vigilancia en méxico la secretaría de gobernación es la encargada de la vigilancia de la aplicación de la ley aunque se puede ayudar de las demás oficinas del gobierno federal como el caso de la secretaría de relaciones exteriores para otras naciones o la secretaría de educación pública para el caso de la difusión y enseñanza importancia cultural aficionados mexicanos interpretando el himno nacional antes de un partido de fútbol tras la escritura del himno méxico seguía enfrentándose a los efectos de una derrota en una guerra con estados unidos el país se sentía desmoralizado y también dividido debido a la pérdida de aproximadamente la mitad de su territorio el cual le pertenecía ya a estados unidos de acuerdo con el historiador javier garciadiego quien habló en una ceremonia conmemorativa del 150º aniversario de la aprobación del himno en 2004 el himno hace caso omiso a las divisiones y conflictos y anima la unidad nacional en esa misma fecha la ciudad de méxico y otras partes del país detuvieron lo que hacían e interpretaron un canto del himno a nivel nacional individuos de otras naciones participaron también mayoritariamente en las oficinas diplomáticas o en lugares donde se encontraban una alta concentración de expatriados de méxico el himno también ha sido descrito como uno de los símbolos de la identidad mexicana antes de 1820 entre los pueblos prehispánicos no se tiene noticia de que existiera al menos algo parecido a un himno que se identificara unívocamente a algunos de los altépetl pero al llegar las tradiciones europeas tras la llamada conquista española florecieron los llamados himnos religiosos en cuyas letras y música alababan la vida de algún santo o la deidad de la iglesia católica así como los himnos cívicos que trataban de alabar la llegada de virreyes de obispos clérigos la entronización de reyes españoles y más comúnmente la vida de algún personaje o grupo novohispano de entre los autores más destacados de ese tipo de himnos tenemos a manuel de sumaya josé de torres y josé aldana cuya obra religiosa fue profusamente elogiadas en su tiempo y aún hoy destacan de toda su obra los himnos dedicados a la virgen de guadalupe la primera vez que existió en méxico algo muy parecido a un himno nacional fue la llamada marcha real o marcha granadera que desde 1761 se empezó a usar en españa y sus colonias durante las ceremonias cívicas autoría de manuel de espinosa de los monteros fue una obra de cierto agrado que influyo en los años posteriores en el nuevo nacionalismo mexicano que se formó durante la guerra de independencia siglo xix al consumarse la independencia de méxico en 1821 el nuevo nacionalismo mexicano solo impulsó la creación de un escudo y bandera nacional como símbolo del nuevo estado al parecer la idea de un himno nacional no era una necesidad por eso durante la entronización de agustín de iturbide se cantó el himno religioso veni creator en forma especial posteriormente el protocolo de toma del cargo para el primer presidente y vicepresidente de méxico no incluyó ningún himno o canción usada como un himno a pesar de eso durante ese primer medio siglo nunca faltaron propuestas informales de himnos que trataron de tomar el lugar por ejemplo durante la etapa final de la guerra de independencia se realizó un sitio a la ciudad de querétaro por parte de tropas trigarantes entre esas tropas se encontraba un músico llamado josé torrescano quien compuso un himno muy anti español cuya frase más cuestionada era somos independientesviva la libertadviva américa librey viva la igualdad por eso no fue muy promovido el himno ya que la idea del ejército trigarante era lograr la unidad de todos los grupos sociales de la nueva españa ya en lo que se considera el méxico independiente en 1822 otro músico de nombre josé maría garmendía realizó otro himno que no gustó por estar muy centrado en la figura de agustín de iturbide por ejemplo sus primeras palabras eran a las armas valientes indianosa las armas corred con valorel partido seguid de iturbideseamos libres y no haya opresión por eso al cambiar de régimen monárquico a republicano este fue totalmente olvidado luego durante las república tanto federalista como centralista cuando se querían hacer honores al presidente o vicepresidente se interpretaba alguna pieza de su agrado por ejemplo antonio lópez de santa anna gustaba de la obertura semiramis de gioachino rossini mientras josé joaquín de herrera prefería poeta y campesino de franz von suppé el 13 de julio de 1844 otro músico de nombre musicalizó un poema anónimo que honraba a antonio lópez de santa anna quien estaba en su 8º periodo de gobierno durante la república centralista este no gustó al público y terminó olvidado en 1849 luego de la desastrosa guerra mexicanaestadounidense de 1846 a 1848 y durante la presidencia federal de josé joaquín de herrera se formó una llamada junta patriótica de la ciudad de méxico que a través de la academia de san juan de letrán organizó un concurso para buscar una letra que junto a la música del pianista austriaco henri herz pudiera formar un himno nacional ese primer concurso fue la propuesta más seria hasta el momento incluía entre sus jueces a personajes muy destacados de la época como andrés quintana roo manuel lacunza josé joaquín pesado manuel carpio y alejandro arango y escandón el concurso fue ganado por el estadounidense andrés david bradburn lo cual junto con el contenido de la obra hizo que fuera un verdadero fracaso que terminó por olvidarse poco después en 1850 la misma academia de san juan de letrán realizó su propio concurso para musicalizar un poema del cubano juan miguel lozada la música seleccionada fue obra de nicoláscharles bochsa pero al ser un poema muy centrado en la figura del presidente josé joaquín de herrera no trascendió al parecer durante ese año se dio una especie de competencia informal ya que el músico italiano antonio barilli propuso no solo un himno propuso dos los cuales de ninguna manera fueron del agrado del pueblo mexicano poco después en 1851 otro músico de origen checo max maretzek presentó su propuesta y no fructificó y así se fueron acumulando en tan solo tres años varios intentos en abril de 1853 el italiano inocencio pellegrini presentó su canto nacional sin mucho éxito si es que tuvo alguno en diciembre de 1853 otro músico de apellido infante creó una composición patriótica dedicada a antonio lópez de santa anna la cual solo se tocó una noche otras personalidades que presentaron propuestas formales e informales fueron fernando calderón y beltrán josé maría garmendia francisco manuel sánchez de tagle mariano elízaga y josé maría heredia competencia oficial no se sabe si debido a esa efervescencia o solo por el gusto del entonces presidente y dictador antonio lópez de santa anna el 12 de noviembre de 1853 por medio del diario oficial del gobierno de la república mexicana se dio a conocer un doble concurso cuyo fin y orden seria seleccionar un poema patriótico y su musicalización posterior para formar un himno a la patria  en 1854 se celebraría el 25 aniversario de la victoria de tampico de 1829 cuando antonio lópez de santa anna venció al ejército español en su intento de reconquista buscó santa anna festejar por todo lo alto su gran victoria militar donde alcanzó el rango de general de división el concurso se convocó con la anticipación debida para que el 11 de septiembre del siguiente año se tuviera el himno nacional arreglado para la letra se solicitaba enviar la propuesta en sobre cerrado con un seudónimo al ministerio de fomento colonización industria y comercio en menos de veinte días tras lo cual se tardarían diez días para definir al ganador luego de darse a conocer al ganador la musicalización tendría otro mes para recibir propuestas tras lo cual se tardaría un mes más para dar a conocer al ganador de la música en la misma convocatoria se definía que los derechos de explotación de las propuestas pasarían a manos del gobierno central y solo se entregaría una contraprestación a los ganadores esta convocatoria fue firmada por el entonces oficial mayor del ministerio miguel lerdo de tejada el jurado para la letra estuvo formado por josé bernardo couto manuel carpio y josé joaquín pesado mientras el jurado para la música se integró por josé antonio gómez agustín balderas y tomás león el resultado para la letra se publicó el 4 de febrero de 1854 en el diario oficial junto a la letra siendo ganador el potosino francisco gonzález bocanegra quien luego se supiera realizó la letra encerrado en una habitación por la que era entonces su prometida guadalupe gonzález del pino ya que él no quería participar en el concurso gonzález fue anunciado el ganador en el diario oficial del gobierno de la república mexicana del 3 de febrero de 1854 si bien el himno de gonzález bocanegra es un himno de corte bélico no lo es de ataque agresión ó expansionismo sino todo lo contrario es un himno de defensa de la patria y del territorio nacional seguramente inspirado en el evento militar que se recordaba y festejaba ese año de 1854 al cumplirse 25 años de la invasión española de reconquista el poeta narra en sus estrofas la situación y disposición de los mexicanos y la nación ante una invasión extranjera no así para una guerra intestina y fratricida santa anna el gran vencedor de tampico sería recordado en ese himno santanista que incluso le fue obsequiado por gonzález bocanegra en la dedicatoria la misma noche de su estreno en el gran teatro de santa anna el himno reseña una gran victoria militar contra un extraño enemigo es decir una nación extranjera la única gran victoria con esas características que se celebraba en méxico en esa época era la obtenida en tampico en 1829  como decía la convocatoria tras darse a conocer al ganador de la letra se abrió el concurso de la música se realizó como se decía en un mes siendo ganadora la obra del músico italiano giovanni bottesini pero simplemente no gusto además fue acusado de musicalizar y dar a conocer por fuera del concurso su propuesta lo cual era contrario a los términos del concurso debido a eso el concurso se prolongó hasta los ciento ochenta días mientras el 18 de mayo de 1854 estreno formalmente su propuesta en el teatro santa anna con las voces de la soprano enriqueta sontag y el tenor gaspar pozzolini pero aun así no fue del agrado del público en general tras esa prolongación a ciento ochenta días fue la propuesta del músico español jaime nunó roca la que ganó por entonces nunó era director de las bandas militares del ejército nacional ese puesto lo había logrado por invitación de antonio lópez de santa anna quien lo había conocido en uno de sus varios exilios en cuba su obra con el seudónimo dios y libertad fue declarada ganadora el 12 de agosto de 1854 por medio del diario oficial del gobierno de la república mexicana el himno fue aceptado el día de la independencia del mismo año la interpretación inaugural fue dirigida por giovanni bottesini cantado por claudia florenti y lorenzo salvi en el teatro santa anna poco más de un mes después la noche del 15 de septiembre de 1854 fue interpretado públicamente por primera vez el himno en el entonces famoso teatro santa anna que por entonces cerraba al poniente la calle que hoy se llama 5 de mayo en el hoy llamado centro histórico de la ciudad de méxico que en aquella época era lo único que se llamaba ciudad de méxico luego de algunas palabras del poeta francisco gonzález bocanegra se interpretó el himno dirigido por giovanni bottesini y las voces de claudina florentini lorenzo salvi y coros del teatro a cargo de rené masón y pedro carvajal esa primera vez no fue el estreno oficial ya que solo hasta el día siguiente fue cuando antonio lópez de santa anna en su carácter de presidente asistió a su interpretación por parte de balbina steffenone y lorenzo salvi al contrario de todos los intentos anteriores su éxito fue casi inmediato y su partitura se vendió en las calles su rechazo y aceptación pero no duro mucho su fortuna el 9 de agosto de 1855 antonio lópez de santa anna deja la presidencia por última vez y abandona méxico jaime nunó le sigue a la habana y luego se pierde en los eeuu a la vez francisco gonzález bocanegra se esconde en casa de un tío para evitar represalias y no vuelve ponerse a descubierto del público muere de tifo el 11 de abril de 1861 a sus 37 años la causa de ese repentino cambio es por la llamada revolución de ayutla que desde el 1 de marzo de 1854 venia impulsando un cambio de gobierno federalista y liberal por la revolución de ayutla los grupos liberales y federalistas se hacen del poder e inicia la llamada época de la reforma que traería personajes como benito juárez melchor ocampo ignacio ramírez miguel lerdo de tejada guillermo prieto juan n álvarez e ignacio comonfort como eran contrarios a santa anna hicieron lo posible para que se olvidara el himno santanista si bien no lo prohibieron de ninguna manera alentaron su interpretación pero poco a poco el himno fue ganando adeptos por ejemplo al final de la guerra de reforma cuando las tropas federales retomaban la ciudad de méxico el gral liberal florencio maría del castillo relata que la comitiva se detuvo frente al primer arco para escuchar el himno cuya letra sentimos no haber conseguido terminado el himno fue entonada la marsellesa esa marcha que conmueve los corazones de todos los pueblos y la multitud repitió el estribillo de lo anterior se puede ampliar que hasta la llamada segunda intervención francesa el himno más popular en méxico entre los liberales y muchos otros grupos era la marsellesa y que aun durante la guerra en el segundo imperio mexicano era el himno preferido por benito juárez para ser tocado en su presencia como presidente de méxico otro himno muy popular aunque no fue escrito como tal fue obra de guillermo prieto quien la había escrito como poema satírico en 1853 apareció en su libro de 1854 viajes de orden suprema ese poema musicalizado había sido presentado al concurso santanista por guillermo prieto a través de un tercero y titulada la marcha de los cangrejos obviamente no ganó pero para 1864 al inicio del segundo imperio mexicano ya era una de las canciones más populares en méxico al punto de que el propio emperador maximiliano solicitó que se tocara en su presencia durante una visita a la ciudad de guanajuato en 1864 como una manera de congraciarse con los liberales pero el efecto fue un severo susto e indignación de los grupos conservadores y monárquicos que lo apoyaron para llegar al trono de ese himno informal melchor ocampo cuenta que los cangrejos convertidos en himno popular formulaban el regocijo y el orden y la concordia embellecían un día que lo sobreponen en grandeza a la recepción del ejército trigarantesic otra obra que llegó a ser muy popular y usada como himno fue adiós mamá carlota que solo por su letra no terminó por oficializarse en todo caso al final de la guerra y con la república restaurada el himno santanista volvió a tener presencia si no es que la tuvo durante toda la guerra aunque con varias modificaciones por ejemplo en 1864 el presidente benito juárez discutió con varios sobre ciertas modificaciones a la letra le sugerían suprimir la referencia al guerrero inmortal de zempoala a lo que contesto al himno nacional no se le quita ni una sola nota ni una sola palabra otro cambio que sí perduró fue en la séptima estrofa cambiando si a la lid contra estado enemigo por si a la lid contra hueste enemiga además de muchas otras que no perduraron tras esa época llegó la presidencia de sebastián lerdo de tejada hermano de quien siendo oficial mayor firmó la convocatoria al concurso de 1853 al parecer desde ese momento se impulsó el uso del himno santanista aunque con modificaciones tras la caída de su gobierno por el plan de tuxtepec el nuevo presidente porfirio díaz empezó a usar el himno santanista de común para las ceremonias oficiales siglo xx en 1901 es redescubierto por decirlo de alguna manera el compositor jaime nunó un grupo de mexicanos que estaban de viaje por estados unidos lo encuentra en la ciudad de buffalo nueva york lo dan a conocer al presidente y este lo invita a visitar méxico acepta y durante su visita por primera vez dirige orquesta y coros para interpretar el himno mexicano pero su visita no resulta cálida y regresa a nueva york para entonces era ciudadano estadounidense en 1904 vuelve a ser invitado con motivo de los cincuenta años del himno con mucho más éxito que la visita anterior esa fue la última vez que vivo tocó suelo mexicano ya que muere el 18 de julio de 1908 en bay city nueva jersey durante su primera visita el 11 de febrero de 1901 tras una sesión solemne se anunció que el congreso de la unión concedía a jaime nunó y gonzález bocanegra la cantidad de dos mil pesos de entonces como contraprestación y premio por el concurso de 1853 por parte de gonzález bocanegra el dinero fue recibido por mercedes serralde de gonzález bocanegra como heredera del poeta además a nunó se le dieron los 388 pesos que puso de su bolsillo para hacer la primera tirada de la partitura en 1854 lo cual él ratificó en una entrevista al diario el imparcial del 9 de julio de 1901 durante las celebraciones del centenario de la independencia se vuelve normal el uso del himno santanista y se le empieza a llamar corrientemente como himno nacional méxicano durante la revolución mexicana ya tiene el sello de aprobación popular y oficial pero sin una reglamentación clara se interpreta con las estrofas a gusto del intérprete aunque algunas ya se destacan entre las diez cuatro de ellas en concreto para la llamada guerra cristera incluso se usa por parte del gobierno anticlerical la segunda estrofa que dice de la paz el arcángel divinoque en el cielo tu eterno destinopor el dedo de dios se escribió la primera vez que se grabó el himno en un medio sonoro fue el 28 de julio de 1922 por la cantante duranguense fanny anitúa su versión al decir de muchos fue deficiente y modificada lo que causó gran polémica al grado de requerir una revisión oficial por parte del consejo cultural del distrito federal la revisión fue llevada a cabo por josé lópez portillo y rojas manuel barajas y julián carrillo durante esta revisión se conoció la pérdida de los textos originales entonces el grupo recurrió a la familia de gonzález bocanegra quienes entregaron originales del estribillo y las estrofas también se consiguió una primera edición del himno bajo el sello de la casa murguía en 1854 por otra parte una de las familias pudientes de la época identificada como pérez salas obsequió una instrumentación del himno que el mismo jaime nunó envió a la plana mayor del ejército nacional y a la dirección general de artillería uno de los que pagó con 388 pesos esa revisión demostró los varios cambios que había sufrido el himno así como la dificultad de interpretarlo completo por eso se empezó a limitar el número de estrofas pero sin seguir una formalidad por eso el 4 de mayo de 1943 el entonces presidente de méxico manuel ávila camacho durante la participación de méxico en la segunda guerra mundial promulgó un decreto que oficializaba el himno y lo limitaba a las estrofas i v vi y x más el estribillo por ese decreto se prohibió alterar corregir o modificar la letra o la música ese decreto se formalizó aún más y conjugó con los otros símbolos patrios el 23 de diciembre de 1967 por la ley sobre las características y el uso del escudo la bandera y el himno nacionales ley que fue suprimida en 1984 por la ley sobre el escudo la bandera y el himno nacionales la cual es el ordenamiento que la rige hasta hoy controversias derechos de autor en 1959 la sociedad repertorio wagner s a publicó una partitura para que se pudiera interpretar el himno nacional mexicano por parte de las bandas civiles de música el decreto de 1943 no tenía una partitura anexa y debía conseguirse aparte además de que no era fácil duplicar el decreto esa publicación levantó varios gritos de histeria y terror entre el pueblo mexicano ya que varios periódicos difundieron la supuesta noticia de que wagner era propietaria o se hacía pasar por propietaria del himno nacional debido a eso por ejemplo se dijo que cada lunes los estudiantes debían dar un peso a su escuela para poder interpretar el himno lo que a todas luces es falso de esta manera durante toda su vida el himno ha estado por decirlo ligeramente lleno de bromas de mal gusto incluso en la era del internet como ejemplo de ello está el rumor de que la casa wagner y levien registró el himno nacional mexicano y que por eso cobraba los derechos de ejecución declarándose propietaria de la obra a nivel internacional situación similar pasa en los eeuu con la casa ralph s perr y compañía pero por más desmentido oficial que hace el gobierno mexicano aún sigue el mito en septiembre de 1959 luego de poner una multa a la casa wagner se realizó una investigación para dilucidar si el rumor de que la familia de jaime nunó había vendido los derechos del autor a una casa musical en los eeuu de la investigación se determinó que no existió tal venta de sus derechos de explotación y menos sus derechos de autor aunque luego se encontró que el mismo jaime nunó había vendido en la década de 1850 sus derechos de explotación efectivamente a una casa de música estadounidense pero solo de un arreglo a la música del himno un arreglo para tocar el himno al piano ese arreglo además estaba en otro ritmo y tenor por lo que era muy diferente a la versión original además para 1960 ya habían pasado los cien años que protegía la legislación estadounidense los derechos de explotación y por la misma legislación al ser una obra anterior a 1909 no le aplicaba la ley vigente en 1953 antes de 1909 no existía ley en eeuu que protegiera eso en último caso no transcendía su ley fuera de sus fronteras otra versión de la venta de los derechos de jaime nunó es como sigue el propio nunó y dos estadounidenses harry henneman y phil hill registraron la música de nuñó con la empresa bmi edward b marks music company fue entonces la editora del himno en los eeuu en 1910 y 1911 por lo que luego de encontrarse con las publicaciones de esa casa editorial varios mexicanos empezaron a propagar el rumor sobre que esa casa comercial era la dueña de los derechos de autor no obstante la ley de los derechos de autor en estados unidos declara que el himno mexicano está en el dominio público dentro de los estados unidos dado que tanto la letra como la música fueron estrenadas antes de 1909 además bajo la ley de derechos de autor en méxico el artículo 155 expone que el gobierno tiene los derechos morales pero no el derecho de autor del himno además de que también en méxico está en dominio público ya que se cumplieron los cien años establecidos para su liberación desde el 2008 himno bélico otra polémica muy habitual se basa en que la letra del himno es muy bélica por ejemplo se dice que el estribillo llama a la guerra mexicanos al grito de guerra por lo que varias veces se ha propuesto modificar o cambiar de plano el himno incluso en tiempos recientes el poeta javier sicilia en una entrevista sobre la caravana con justicia y dignidad a la pregunta de también lo preguntaba por el lábaro patrio porque he visto que te molesta el belicismo del himno nacional de méxico respondió sicilia cuando han intentado cantar el himno en el templete de las caravanas yo digo no habría que cambiarlo si lo escuchamos es el problema de no atender a las palabras el himno justifica la guerra necesitamos cambiar la letra esa letra no nos representa fue de un momento histórico y no es el que vivimos estamos en la búsqueda de la paz del amor del reconocimiento de lo humano por encima de las fronteras y nacionessic esa polémica básicamente se ve en personajes de la izquierda mexicana como lo es sicilia es un himno de la derecha en forma paralela sobre el tema belicista del himno esta la polémica sobre su origen santanista ya que antonio lópez de santa anna es uno si no el más odiado personaje de la historia mexicana sobre todo se recuerda su participación en la guerra mexicanaestadounidense y en la guerra texana los principales defensores de esta polémica están en la llamada izquierda mientras los llamados políticos de derecha normalmente defienden el himno como una obra propia de su tiempo que ha ganado su lugar en la historia y estima del pueblo como refuerzo del rechazo al himno se marca su estilo musical conocido como quinta real por su parecido con la marcha real una marcha militar que desde 1791 se usa como himno de españa cine en 1943 cuando se oficializó el himno se estrenó la película mexicanos al grito de guerra dirigida por álvaro gálvez y fuentes e ismael rodríguez y protagonizada por pedro infante y lina montes cuya trama básica es la supuesta historia del himno nacional hasta la batalla del 5 de mayo en puebla en la parte final se muestra a los soldados mexicanos cantando el himno para darse valor pero ningún documento histórico ha podido respaldar esa escena el segundo durante décadas se ha dicho e incluso medios de comunicación han informado que el himno nacional mexicano es considerado el segundo más bello del mundo detrás de la marsellesa pero hasta el día de hoy no se ha llevado a cabo ningún tipo de concurso o competición arbitrada que avale ese dicho incluso es común oír este mito aplicado a otros himnos nacionales como por ejemplo el ecuatoriano colombiano peruano inglés estadounidense etc versión original versión

language atwood uses in this section is significant becauseyour idea the ceremony goes as usual i lie on my back fully clothed except for the healthy white cotton underdrawers what i could see if i were to open my eyes would be the large white canopy of serena joys outsized colonialstyle fourposter bed suspended like a sagging cloud above us a cloud sprigged with tiny drops of silver rain which if you looked at them closely would turn out to be fourpetaled flowers i would not see the carpet which is white or the sprigged curtains and skirted dressing table with its silverbacked brush and mirror set only the canopy which manages to suggest at one and the same time by the gauziness of its fabric and its heavy downward curve both ethereality and matter or the sail of a ship bigbellied sails they used to say in poems bellying propelled forward by a swollen belly a mist of lily of the valley surrounds us chilly crisp almost its not warm in this room above me towards the head of the bed serena joy is arranged outspread her legs are apart i lie between them my head on her stomach her pubic bone under the base of my skull her thigh on either side of me she too is fully clothed my arms are raised she holds my hands each of mine in each of hers this is supposed to signify that we are one flesh one being what it really means is that she is in control of the process and thus of the productif any the rings of her left hand cut into my fingers it may or may not be revenge my red skirt is hitched up to my waist though no higher below it the commander is fucking what he is fucking is the lower part of my body i do not say making love because this is not what hes doing copulating too would be inaccurate because it would imply two people and only one is involved nor does rape cover it nothing is going on here that i havent signed up for there wasnt a lot of choice but there was some and this is what i chose therefore i lie still and picture the unseen canopy over my head i remember queen victorias advice to her daughter close your eyes and think of england but this is not england i wish he would hurry up maybe im crazy and this is some new kind of therapy i wish it were true then i could get better and this would go away serena joy grips my hands as if it is she not i whos being fucked as if she finds it either pleasurable or painful and the commander fucks with a regular twofour marching stroke on and on like a tap dripping he is preoccupied like a man humming to himself in the shower without knowing hes humming like a man who has other things on his mind its as if hes somewhere else waiting for himself to come drumming his fingers on the table while he waits theres an impatience in his rhythm now but isnt this everyones wet dream two women at once they used to say that exciting they used to say whats going on in this room under serena joys silvery canopy is not exciting it has nothing to do with passion or love or romance or any of those other notions we used to titillate ourselves with it has nothing to do with sexual desire at least for me and certainly not for serena arousal and orgasm are no longer thought necessary they would be a symptom of frivolity merely like jazz garters or beauty spots superfluous distractions for the lightminded outdated it seems odd that women once spent such time and energy reading about such thingsthinking about them worrying about them writing about them they are so obviously recreational this is not recreation even for the commander this is serious business the commander too is doing his duty if i were going to open my eyes a slit i would be able to see him his notunpleasant face hanging over my torso with a few strands of his silver hair falling perhaps over his forehead intent on his inner journey that place he is hurrying towards which recedes as in a dream at the same speed with which he approaches it i would see his open eyes if he were better looking would i enjoy this more at least hes an improvement on the previous one who smelled like a church cloakroom in the rain like your mouth when the dentist starts picking at your teeth like a nostril the commander instead smells of mothballs or is this odor some punitive form of aftershave why does he have to wear that stupid uniform but would i like his white tufted raw body any better kissing is forbidden between us this makes it bearable one detaches oneself one describes he comes at last with a stifled groan as of relief serena joy who has been holding her breath expels it the commander who has been propping himself on his elbows away from our combined bodies doesnt permit himself to sink down into us he rests a moment withdraws recedes rezippers he nods then turns and leaves the room closing the door with exaggerated care behind him as if both of us are his ailing mother theres something hilarious about this but i dont dare laugh serena joy lets go of my hands you can get up now she says get up and get out shes supposed to have me rest for ten minutes with my feet on a pillow to improve the chances this is meant to be a time of silent meditation for her hut shes not in the mood for that there is loathing in her voice as if the touch of my flesh sickens and contaminates her i untangle myself from her body stand up the juice of the commander runs down my legs before i turn away i see her straighten her blue skirt clench her legs together she continues lying on the bed gazing up at the canopy above her stiff and straight as an effigy which of us is it worse for her or me atwoods

chapter and annotate talk to each other look for the connections so that you bring to our next harkness discussion ii shopping  2 a chair a table a lamp above on the white ceiling a relief ornament in the shape of a wreath and in the center of it a blank space plastered over like the place in a face where the eye has been taken out there must have been a chandelier once theyve removed anything you could tie a rope to a window two white curtains under the window a window seat with a little cushion when the window is partly open it only opens partly the air can come in and make the curtains move i can sit in the chairor on the window seat hands folded and watch this sunlight comes in through the window too ami falls on the floor which is made of wood in narrow strips highly polished i can smell the polish theres a rug on the floor oval of braided rags this is the kind of touch they like folk art archaic made by women in their spare time from things that have no further use a return to traditional values waste not want not i am not being wasted why do 1 want on the wall above the chair a picture framed but with no glass a print of flowers blue irises watercolor flowers are still allowed does each of us have the same print the same chair the same while curtains i wonder government issue think of it as being in the army said aunt lydia a bed single mattress mediumhard covered with a flocked white spread nothing takes place in the bed but sleep or no sleep i try not to think too much like other things now thought must be rationed theres a lot that doesnt bear thinking about thinking can hurt your chances and i intend to last i know why there is no glass in front of the watercolor picture of blue irises and why the window opens only partly and why the glass in it is shatterproof it isnt running away theyre afraid of we wouldnt get far its those other escapes the ones you can open in yourself given a cutting edge so apart from these details this could be a college guest room for the less distinguished visitors or a room in a rooming house of former times for ladies in reduced circumstances that is what we are now the circumstances have been reduced for those of us who still have circumstances but a chair sunlight flowers these are not to be dismissed i am alive i live i breathe i put my hand out unfolded into the sunlight where i am is not a prison but a privilege as aunt lydia said who was in love with eitheror the bell that measures time is ringing time here is measured by bells as once in nunneries as in a nunnery too there are few mirrors i get up out of the chair advance my feet into the sunlight in their red shoes flatheeled to save the spine and not for dancing the red gloves are lying on the bed i pick them up pull them onto my hands finger by finger everything except the wings around my face is red the color of blood which defines us the skirt is anklelength full gathered to a flat yoke that extends over the breasts the sleeves are full the white wings too are prescribed issue they are to keep us from seeing but also from being seen i never looked good in red its not my color i pick up the shopping basket put it over my arm the door of the room not my room i refuse to say my is not locked in fact it doesnt shut properly i go out into the polished hallwaywhich has a runner down the center dusty pink like a path through the forest like a carpet for royalty it shows me the way the carpet bends and goes down the front staircase and i go with it one hand on the banister once a tree turned in another century rubbed to a warm gloss late victorian the house is a family house built for a large rich family theres a grandfather clock in the hallway which doles out time and then the door to the motherly front sitting room with its flesh tones and hints a sitting room in which i never sit but stand or kneel only at the end of the hallway above the front door is a fanlight of colored glass flowers red and blue there remains a mirror on the hall wall if i turn my head so that the white wings framing my face direct my vision towards it i can see it as i go down the stairs round convex a pier glass like the eye of a fish and myself in it like a distorted shadow a parody of something some fairytale figure in a red cloak descending towards a moment of carelessness that is the same as danger a sister dipped in blood at the bottom of the stairs theres a hatandumbrella stand the bentwood kind long rounded rungs of wood curving gently up into hooks shaped like the opening fronds of a fern there are several umbrellas in it black for the commander blue for the commanders wife and the one assigned to me which is red i leave the red umbrella where it is because i know from the window that the day is sunny i wonder whether or not the commanders wileis in the sitting room she doesnt always sit sometimes 1 can hear her pacing back and forth a heavy step and then a light one anil the soft tap of her cane on the dustyrose carpet i walk along the hallway past the sitting room door and the door that leads into the dining room and open the door at the end of the hall and go through into the kitchen here the smell is no longer of furniture polish rita is in here standing at the kitchen table which has a top of chipped white enamel shes in her usual marthas dress which is dull green like a surgeons gown of the time before the dress is much like mine in shape long and concealing but with a bib apron over it and without the white wings and the veil she puts on the veil to go outside but nobody much cares who sees the face of a martha her sleeves are rolled in the elbow showing her brown arms shes making bread throwing the loaves for the final brief kneading and then the shaping rita sees me and nods whether in greeting or in simple acknowledgment of my presence its hard to say and wipes her floury hands on her apron and rummages in the kitchen drawer for the token book frowning she tears out three tokens and hands them to me her face might be kindly if she would smile but the frown isnt personal its the red dress she disapproves of and what it stands for she thinks i may be catching like a disease or any form of bad luck sometimes i listen outside closed doors a thing i never would have done in the time before i dont listen long because i dont want to be caught doing it once though i heard rita say to cora i hat she wouldnt debase herself like that nobody asking you cora said anyways what could you do supposing go to the colonies rita said they have the choice with the unwomen and starve to death and lord knows what all said cora catch you they were shelling peas even through the almostclosed door i could hear the light clink of the hard peas falling into the metal howl i heard rita a grunt or a sigh of protest or agreement anyways theyre doing it for us all said cora or so they say if i hadnt of got my tubes tied it could of been me say i was ten years younger its not that bad its not what youd call hard work better her than me rita said and i opened the door their faces were the way womens faces are when theyve been talking about you behind your back and they think youve heard embarrassed but also a little defiant as if it were their right that day cora was more pleasant to me than usual rita more surly today despite ritas closed face and pressed lips i would like to stay here in the kitchen cora might come in from somewhere else in the house carrying her bottle of lemon oil and her duster and rita would make coffee in the houses of the commanders there is still real coffee and we would sit at ritas kitchen table which is not ritas any more than my table is mine and we would talk about aches and pains illnesses our feet our backs all the different kinds of mischief that our bodies like unruly children can get into we would nod our heads as punctuation to each others voices signaling that yes we know all about it we would exchange remedies and try to outdo each other in the recital of our physical miseries gently we would complain our voices soft and minor key and mournful as pigeons in the eaves troughs  know what you mean wed say or a quaint expression you sometimes hear still from older people  hear where youre coming from as if the voice itself were a traveler arriving from a distant place which it would be which it is how i used to despise such talk now i long for it at least it was talk an exchange of sorts or we would gossip the marthas know things they talk among themselves passing the unofficial news from house to house like me they listen at doors no doubt and see things even with their eyes averted ive heard them at it sometimes caught whiffs of their private conversations stillborn it was or stabbed her with a knitting needle right in the belly jealousy it must have been eating her up or tantalizingly it was toilet cleaner she used worked like a charm though youd think hed of tasted it mustve been that drunk but they found her out all right or i would help rita make the bread sinking my hands into that soft resistant warmth which is so much like flesh i hunger to touch something other than cloth or wood i hunger to commit the act of touch but even if i were to ask even if i were to violate decorum to that extent rita would not allow it she would he too alrd t marthas are not supposed to fraternize with us fraternize means to behave like a brother luke told me that he said there was no corresponding word that that meant to behave like a sister sororize it would have to be he said from the latin he liked knowing about such details the derivations of words curious usages i used to tease him about being pedantic i take the tokens from ritas outstretched hand they have pictures on them of the things they can be exchanged for twelve eggs a piece of cheese a brown thing thats supposed to be a steak i place them in the zippered pocket in my sleeve where 1 keep my pass tell them fresh for the eggs she any not like the last time and a chicken tell them not a hen tell them who its for and then they wont mess around all right i say i dont smile why tempt her to friendship 4 i walk along the gravel path that divides the back lawn neatly like a hair parting it has rained during the night the grass to either side is damp the air humid here and there are worms evidence of the fertility of the soil caught by the sun half dead flexible and pink like lips i open the white picket gate and continue past the front lawn and towards the front gate in the driveway one of the guardians assigned to our household is washing the car that must mean the commander is in the house in his own quarters past the dining room and beyond where he seems to stay most of the time the car is a very expensive one a whirlwind better than the chariot much better than the chunky practical behemoth its black of course the color of prestige or a hearse and long and sleek the driver is going over it with a chamois lovingly this it least hasnt changed the way men caress good cars hes wearing the uniform of the guardians but his cap is tilted at a jaunty angle and his sleeves are rolled to the dhow showing his forearms tanned but with a stipple of dark hairs he has a cigarette stuck in the corner of his mouth which shows that he too has something he can trade on the black market i know this mans name nick i know this because ive heard rita and cora talking about him and once i heard the commander speaking to him nick i wont be needing the car he lives here in the household over the garage low status he hasnt been issued a woman not even one he doesnt rate some defect lack of connections but he acts as if he doesnt know this or care hes too casual hes not servile enough it may be stupidity but i dont think so smells fishy they used to say or i smell a rat misfit as odor despite myself i think of how he might smell not fish or decaying rat tanned skin moist in the sun filmed with smoke i sigh inhaling he looks at me and sees me looking he has a french face lean whimsical all planes and angles with creases around the mouth where he smiles he takes a final puff of the cigarette lets it drop to the driveway and steps on it he begins to whistle then he winks i drop my head and turn so that the white wings hide my face and keep walking hes just taken a risk but for what what if i were to report him perhaps he was merely being friendly perhaps he saw the look on my face and mistook it for something else really what i wanted was the cigarette perhaps it was a test to see what i would do perhaps he is an eye i open the front gate and close it behind me looking down but not back the sidewalk is red brick that is the landscape i focus on a held of oblongs gently undulating where the earth beneath has buckled from decade after decade of winter frost the color of the bricks is old yet fresh and clear sidewalks are kept much cleaner tan they used to be i walk to the corner and wait i used to be bad at waiting they also serve who only stand and wait said aunt lydia she made us memorize it she also said not all of you will make it through some of you will fall on dry ground or thorns some of you are shallowrooted she had a mole on her chin that went up and down while she talked she said think of yourselves as seeds and right then her voice was wheedling conspiratorial like the voices of those women who used to teach ballet classes to children and who would say arms up in the air now lets pretend were trees i stand on the corner pretending i am a tree a shape red with white wings around the face a shape like mine a nondescript woman in red carrying a basket comes along the brick sidewalk towards me she reaches me and we peer at each others faces looking down the white tunnels of cloth that enclose us she is the right one blessed be the fruit she says to me the accepted greeting among us may the lord open i answer the accepted response we turn and walk together past the large houses towards the central part of town we arent allowed to go there except in twos this is supposed to be for our protection though the notion is absurd we are well protected already the truth is that she is my spy as i am hers if either of us slips through the net because of something that happens on one of our daily walks the other will be accountable this woman has been my partner for two weeks i dont know what happened to the one before on a certain day she simply wasnt there anymore and this one was there in her place it isnt the sort of thing you ask questions about because the answers are not usually answers you want to know anyway there wouldnt be an answer this one is a little plumper than i am her eyes are brown her name is ofglen and thats about all i know about her she walks demurely head down redgloved hands clasped in from with short little steps like a trained pigs on its hind legs during these walks she has never said anything that was not strictly orthodox but then neither have i she may be a real believer a handmaid in more than name i cant take the risk the war is going well i hear she says praise be i reply weve been sent good weather which i receive with joy theyve defeated more of the rebels since yesterday praise be i say i dont ask her how she knows what were they baptists they had a stronghold in the blue hills they smoked them out praise be sometimes i wish she would just shut up and let me walk in peace but im ravenous for news any kind of news even if its false news it must mean something we reach the first barrier which is like the barriers blocking off roadworks or dugup sewers a wooden crisscross painted in yellow and black stripes a red hexagon which means stop near the gateway there are some lanterns not lit because it isnt night above us i know there are floodlights attached to the telephone poles for use in emergencies and there are men with machine guns in the pillboxes on either side of the road i dont see the floodlights and the pillboxes because of the wings around my face i just know they are there behind the barrier waiting for us at the narrow gateway there are two men in the green uniforms of the guardians of the faith with the crests on their shoulders and berets two swords crossed above a white triangle the guardians arent real soldiers theyre used for routine policing and other menial functions digging up the commanders wifes garden for instance and theyre either stupid or older or disabled or very young apart from the ones that are eyes incognito these two are very young one mustache is still sparse one face is still blotchy their youth is touching but i know i cant be deceived by it the young ones are often the most dangerous the most fanatical the jumpiest with their guns they havent yet learned about existence through time you have to go slowly with them last week they shot a woman right about here she was a martha she was fumbling in her robe for her pass and they thought she was hunting for a bomb they thought she was a man in disguise there have been such incidents rita and cora knew the woman i heard them talking about it in the kitchen doing their job said cora keeping us safe nothing safer than dead said rita angrily she was minding her own business no call to shoot her it was an accident said cora no such thing said rita everything is meant i could hear her thumping the pots around in the sink well someonell think twice before blowing up this house any ways said cora all the same said rita she worked hard that was a bad death i can think of worse said cora at least it was quick you can say that said rita id choose to have some time before like to set things right the two young guardians salute us raising three fingers to the rims of their berets such tokens are accorded to us they are supposed to show respect because of the nature of our service we produce our passes from the zippered pockets in our wide sleeves and they are inspected and stamped one man goes into the righthand pillbox to punch our numbers into the compuchek in returning my pass the one with the peachcolored mustache bends his head to try to get a look at my face i raise my head a little to help him and he sees my eyes and i see his and he blushes his face is long and mournful like a sheeps but with the large full eyes of a dog spaniel not terrier his skin is pale and looks unwholesomely tender like the skin under a scab nevertheless i think of placing my hand on it this exposed face he is the one who turns away its an event a small defiance of rule so small as to be undetectable but such moments are the rewards i hold out for myself like the candy i hoarded as a child at the back of a drawer such moments are possibilities tiny peepholes what if i were to come at night when hes on duty alone though he would never be allowed such solitude and permit him beyond my white wings what if i were to peel off my red shroud and show myself to him to them by the uncertain light of the lanterns this is what they must think about sometimes as they stand endlessly beside this barrier past which nobody ever comes except the commanders of the faithful in their long black murmurous cars or their blue wives and whiteveiled daughters on their dutiful way to salvagings or prayvaganzas or their dumpy green marthas or the occasional birthmobile or their read handmaids on foot or sometimes a blackpainted van with the winged eye in white on the side the windows of the vans are darktinted and the men in the front seats wear dark glasses a double obscurity the vans are surely more silent than the other cars when they pass we avert our eyes if there are sounds coming from inside we try not to hear them nobodys heart is perfect when the black vans reach a checkpoint theyre waved through without a pause the guardians would not want to take the risk of looking inside searching doubting their authority whatever they think if they do think you cant tell by looking at them but more likely they dont think in terms of clothing discarded on the lawn if they think of a kiss they must then think immediately of the floodlights going on the rifle shots they think instead of doing their duty and of promotion to the angels and of being allowed possibly to marry and then if they are able to gain enough power and live to be old enough of being allotted a handmaid of their own the one with the mustache opens the small pedestrian gate for us and stands back well out of the way and we pass through as we walk away i know theyre watching these two men who arent yet permitted to touch women they touch with their eyes instead and i move my hips a little feeling the full red skirt sway around me its like thumbing your nose from behind a fence or teasing a dog with a bone held out of reach and im ashamed of myself for doing it because none of this is the fault of these men theyre too young then i find im not ashamed after all i enjoy the power power of a dog bone passive but there i hope they get hard at the sight of us and have to rub themselves against the painted barriers surreptitiously they will suffer later at night in their regimented beds they have no outlets now except themselves and thats a sacrilege there are no more magazines no more films no more substitutes only me and my shadow walking away from the two men who stand at attention stiffly by a roadblock watching our retreating shapes 8 the good weather holds its almost like june when we would get out our sundresses and our sandals and go for an ice cream cone there are three new bodies on the wall one is a priest still wearing the black cassock thats been put on him for the trial even though they gave up wearing those years ago when the sect wars first began cassocks made them too conspicuous the two others have purple placards hung around their necks gender treachery their bodies still wear the guardian uniforms caught together they must have been but where a barracks a shower its hard to say the snowman with the red smile is gone we should go back i say to ofglen im always the one to say this sometimes i feel that if i didnt say it she would slay here forever but is she mourning or gloating i still cant tell without a word she swivels as if shes voiceactivated as if shes on little oiled wheels as if shes on top of a music box i resent this grace of hers i resent her meek head bowed as if onto a heavy wind but there is no wind we leave the wall walk back the way we came in the warm sun its a beautiful may day ofglen says i feel rather than see her head turn towards me waiting for a reply yes i say praise be i add as an afterthought mayday used to he a distress signal a long time ago in one of those wars we studied in high school i kept getting them mixed up but you could tell them apart by the airplanes if you paid attention it was luke who told me about mayday though mayday mayday for pilots whose planes had been hit and ships was it ships tooat sea maybe it was sos for ships i wish i could look it up and it was something from beethoven for the beginning of the victory in one of those wars do you know what it came from said luke mayday no i said its a strange word to use for that isnt it newspapers and coffee on sunday mornings before she was born there were still newspapers then we used to read them in bed its french he said from maidez help me coming towards us theres a small procession a funeral three women each with a black transparent veil thrown over her headdress an econowife and two others the mourners also econowives her friends perhaps their striped dresses are wornlooking as are their faces some day when times improve says aunt lydia no one will have to be an econowife the first one is the bereaved the mother she carries asmall black jar from the size of the jar you can tell how old it was when it foundered inside her flowed to its death two or three months too young to tell whether or not it was an unbaby the older ones and those that die at birth have boxes we pause out of respect while they go by i wonder if ofglen feels what i do pain like a stab in the belly we put our hands over our hearts to show these stranger women that we feel with them in their loss beneath her veil the first one scowls at us one of the others turns aside spits on the sidewalk the econowives do not like us we go past the shops and come to the barrier again and are passed through we continue on among the large emptylooking houses the weedless lawns at the corner near the house where im posted ofglen stops turns to me under his eye she says the right farewell under his eye i reply and she gives a little nod she hesitates as if to say something more but then she turns away and walks down the street i watch her shes like my own reflection in a mirror from which i am moving away in the driveway nick is polishing the whirlwind again hes reached the chrome at the back i put my gloved hand on the latch of the gate open it push inward the gate clicks behind me the tulips along the border are redder than ever opening no longer wine cups but chalices thrusting themselves up to what end they are after all empty when they are old they turn themselves inside out then explode slowly the petals thrown out like shards nick looks up and begins to whistle then he says nice walk i nod but do not answer with my voice he isnt supposed to speak to me of course some of them will try said aunt lydia all flesh is weak all flesh is grass i corrected her in my head they cant help it she said god made them that way but he did not make you that way he made you different its up to you to set the boundaries later you will be thanked in the garden behind the house the commanders wife is sitting in the chair shes had brought out serena joy what a stupid name its like something youd put on your hair in the other time the time before to straighten it serena joy it would say on the bottle with a womans head in cutpaper silhouette on a pink oval background with scalloped gold edges with everything to choose from in the way of names why did she pick that one serena joy was never her real name not even then her real name was pain i read that in a profile on her in a news magazine long after id first watched her singing while my mother slept in on sunday mornings by that time she was worthy of a profile time or newsweek it was it must have been she wasnt singing anymore by i then she was making speeches she was good at it het speeches were about the sanctity of the home about how women should stay home serena joy didnt do this herself she made speeches instead but she presented this failure of hers as a sacrifice shes was limiting or the good of all around that time someone tried to shoot her and missed her secretary who was standing right behind her was killed instead someone else planted a bomb in her ear but it went off loo early though some people said shed put the bomb in her own car for sympathy thats how hot things were getting luke and i would watch her sometimes on the latenight news bathrobes nightcaps wed watch her sprayed hair and her hysteria and the tears she could still produce at will and the mascara blackening her cheeks by that time she was wearing more makeup we thought she was funny or luke thought she was funny i only pretended to think so really she was a little frightening she was in earnest she doesnt make speeches anymore she has become speechless she stays in her home but it doesnt seem to agree with her how furious she must be now that shes been taken at her word shes looking at the tulips her cane is beside her on the grass her profile is towards me i can see that in the quick sideways look i take at her as i go past it wouldnt do to stare its no longer a flawless cutpaper profile her face is sinking in upon itself and i think of those towns built on underground rivers where houses iul whole streets disappear overnight into sudden quagmires or coal towns collapsing into the mines beneath them something like this must have happened to her once she saw the true shape of tilings to come she doesnt turn her head she doesnt acknowledge my presence in any way although she knows im there i can tell she knows its like a smell her knowledge something gone sour like old milk its not the husbands you have to watch out for said aunt lydia its the wives you should always try to imagine what they must l팿 feeling of course they will resent you it is only natural try in feel for them aunt lydia thought she was very good at feeling lor other people try to pity them forgive them for they know not what they do again the tremulous smile of a beggar the weakeyed blinking the gaze upwards through the round steelrimmed glasses towards the back of the classroom as if the greenpainted plaster ceiling were opening and god on a cloud of pink pearl face powder were coming down through the wires and sprinkler plumbing you must realize that they are defeated women they have been unable here her voice broke off and there was a pause during which i could hear a sigh a collective sigh from those around me it was a bad idea to rustle or fidget during these pauses aunt lydia might look abstracted but she was aware of every twitch so there was only the sigh the future is in your hands she resumed she held her own hands out to us the ancient gesture that was both an offering and an invitation to come forward into an embrace an acceptance in your hands she said looking down at her own hands as if they had given her the idea but there was nothing in them they were empty it was our hands that were supposed to be full of the future which could be held but not seen i walk around to the back door open it go in set my basket down on the kitchen table the table has been scrubbed off cleared of flour todays bread freshly baked is cooling on its rack the kitchen smells of yeast a nostalgic smell it reminds me of other kitchens kitchens that were mine it smells of mothers although my own mother did not make bread it smells of me in former times when i was a mother this is a treacherous smell and i know i must shut it out rita is there sitting at the table peeling and slicing carrots old carrots they are thick ones overwintered bearded from their time in storage the new carrots tender and pale wont be ready for weeks the knife she uses is sharp and bright and tempting i would like to have a knife like that rita stops chopping the carrots stands up takes the parcels out of the basket almost eagerly she looks forward to seeing what ive brought although she always frowns while opening the parcels nothing i bring fully pleases her shes thinking she could have done better herself she would rather do the shopping gel exactly what she wants she envies me the walk in this house we all envy each other something theyve got oranges i say at milk and honey there are still some left i hold out this idea to her like an offering i wish to ingratiate myself i saw the oranges yesterday bill i didnt tell rita yesterday she was too grumpy i could get some tomorrow if youd give me the tokens for them i hold on the chicken to her she wanted steak today but there wasnt any rita grunts not revealing pleasure or acceptance shell think it the grunt says in her own sweet time she undoes the string on the chicken and the glared paper she prods the chicken flexes a wing pokes a finger into the cavity fishes out the giblets the chicken lies there headless and without feet goose pimpled as though shivering bath day rita says without looking at me cora comes into the kitchen from the pantry at the back where they keep the mops and brooms a chicken she says almost with delight scrawny says rita but itll have to do ihere wasnt much else i say rita ignores me looks big enough to me says cora is she standing up for me 1 look at her to see if i should smile but no its only the food shes thinking of shes younger than rita the sunlight coming slant now through the west window catches her hair parted and drawn back she must have been pretty quite recently theres a little mark like a dimple in each of her ears where the punctures for earrings have grown over tall says rita but bony you should speak up she says to me looking directly at me for the first time aint like youre common she means the commanders rank but in the other sense her sense she thinks i am common she is over sixty her minds made up she goes to the sink runs her hands briefly under the tap dries than on the dishtowel the dishtowel is white with blue stripes dishtowels are the same as they always were sometimes these flashes of normality come at me from the side like ambushes the ordinary the usual a reminder like a kick i see the dishtowel out of context and i catch my breath for some in some ways things havent changed that much whos doing the bath says rita to cora not to me i got to tenderize this bird ill do it later says cora after the dusting just so it gets done says rita theyre talking about me as though i cant hear to them im a household chore one among many ive been dismissed i pick up the basket go through the kitchen door and along the hall towards the grandfather clock the sitting room door is closed sun comes through the fanlight falling in colors across the floor red and blue purple i step into it briefly stretch out my hands they fill with flowers of light i go up the stairs my face distant and white and distorted framed in the hall mirror which bulges outward like an eye under pressure i follow the dustypink runner down the long upstairs hallway back to the room theres someone standing in the hall near the door to the room where i stay the hall is dusky this is a man his back to me hes looking into the room dark against its light i can see now its the commander he isnt supposed to be here he hears me coming turns hesitates walks forward towards me he is violating custom what do i do now i stop he pauses i cant see his face hes looking at me what does he want but then he moves forward again steps to the side to avoid touching me inclines his head is gone something has been shown to me but what is it like the flag of an unknown country seen for an instant above a curve of hill it could mean attack it could mean parley it could mean the edge of something a territory the signals animals give one another lowered blue eyelids ears laid back raised hackles a flash of bared teeth what in hell does he think hes doing nobody else has seen him i hope was he invading was he in my room i called it mine 11 yesterday morning i went to the doctor was taken by a guardian one of those with the red arm bands who are in charge of such things we rode in a red car him in the front me in the back no twin went with me on these occasions im solitaire im taken to the doctors once a month for tests urine hormones cancer smear blood test the same as before except that now its obligatory the doctors office is in a modern office building we ride up in the elevator silently the guardian facing me in the blackmirror wall of the elevator i can see the back of his head at the office itself i go in he waits outside in the hall with the other guardians on one of the chairs placed there for that purpose inside the waiting room there are other women three of them in red this doctor is a specialist covertly we regard each other sizing up each others bellies is anyone lucky the nurse records our names and the numbers from our passes on the compudoc to see if we are who we are supposed to be hes six feet tall about forty a diagonal scar across his check he sits typing his hands too big for the keyboard still wearing his pistol in the shoulder holster when im called i go through the doorway into the inner room its white featureless like the outer one except for the folding screen red cloth stretched on a frame a gold eye painted on it with a snaketwined sword upright beneath it like a sort of handle the snakes and the sword are bits of broken symbolism left over from the time before after ive filled the small bottle left ready for me in the little washroom i take off my clothes behind the screen and leave them folded on the chair when im naked i lie down on the examining table on the sheet of chilly crackling disposable paper i pull the second sheet the cloth one up over my body at neck level theres another sheet suspended from the ceiling it intersects me so that the doctor will never see my face he deals with a torso only when im arranged i reach my hand out fumble for the small lever at the right side of the table pull it back somewhere else a bell rings unheard by me after a minute the door opens footsteps come in there is breathing he isnt supposed to speak to me except when its absolutely necessary but this doctor is talkative how are we getting along he says some tic of speech from the other time the sheet is lifted from my skin a draft pimples me a cold finger rubberclad and jellied slides into me i am poked and prodded the finger retreats enters otherwise withdraws nothing wrong with you the doctor says as if to himself any pain honey he calls me honey no i say my breasts are fingered in their turn a search for ripeness rot the breathing comes nearer i smell old smoke aftershave tobacco dust on hair then the voice very soft close to my head thats him bulging the sheet i could help you he says whispers what i say shh he says i could help you ive helped others help me i say my voice as low as his how does he know something has he seen luke has he found can he bring back how do you think he says still barely breathing it is that his hand sliding up my leg hes taken off the glove the doors locked no one will come in theyll never know it isnt his he lifts the sheet the lower part of his face is covered by the white gauze mask regulation two brown eyes a nose a head i with brown hair on it his hand is between my legs most of those old guys cant make it anymore he says or theyre sterile i almost gasp hes said a forbidden word sterile there is no such thing as a sterile man anymore not officially there are only women who are fruitful and women who are barren thats the law lots of women do it he goes on you want a baby dont you yes i say its true and i dont ask why because i know give me children or else i die theres more than one meaning to it youre soft he says its time today or tomorrow would do it why waste it itd only take a minute honey what he called his wife once maybe still does but really its a generic term we are all honey i hesitate hes offering himself to me his services at some risk to himself i hate to see what they put you through he murmurs its genuine genuine sympathy and yet hes enjoying this sympathy and all his eyes are moist with compassion his hand is moving on me nervously and with impatience its too dangerous i say no i cant the penalty is death but they have to catch you in the act with two witnesses what are the odds is the room bugged whos waiting just outside the door his hand stops think about it he says ive seen your chart you dont have a lot of time left but its your life thank you i say i must leave the impression dial im not offended that im open to suggestion he takes his hand away lazily almost lingeringly this is not the last word as far as hes concerned he could fake the tests report me for cancer or infertility have me shipped off to the colonies with the unwomen none of this has been said but the knowledge of his power hangs nevertheless in the air as he pats my thigh withdrew himself behind the hanging sheet next month he says i put on my clothes again behind the screen my hands are shaking why am i frightened ive crossed no boundaries ive given no trust taken no risk all is safe its the choice that terrifies me a way out a salvation 12 the bathroom is beside the bedroom its papered in small blue flowers forgetmenots with curtains to match theres a blue bath mat a blue fakefur cover on the toilet seat all this bathroom lacks from the time before is a doll whose skirt conceals the extra roll of toilet paper except that the mirror over the sink has been taken out and replaced by an oblong of tin and the door has no lock and there are no razors of course there were incidents in bathrooms at first there were cuttings drownings before they got all the bugs ironed out cora sits on a chair outside in the hall to see that no one else goes in in a bathroom in a bathtub you are vulnerable said aunt lydia she didnt say to what the bath is a requirement but it is also a luxury merely to lift off the heavy white wings and the veil merely to feel my own hair again with my hands is a luxury my hair is long now untrimmed hair must be long but covered aunt lydia said saint paul said its either that or a close shave she laughed that heldback neighing of hers as if shed told a joke cora has run the bath it steams like a bowl of soup i take off the rest of the clothes the overdress the white shift and petticoat the red stockings the loose cotton pantaloons pantyhose gives you crotch rot moira used to say aunt lydia would never have used an expression like crotch rot unhygienic was hers she wanted everything to be very hygienic my nakedness is strange to me already my body seems outdated did i really wear bathing suits at the beach i did without thought among men without caring that my legs my arms my thighs and back were on display could be seen shameful immodest i avoid looking down at my body not so much because its shameful or immodest but because i dont want to see it i dont want to look at something that determines me so completely i step into the water lie down let it hold me the water is soft as hands i close my eyes and shes there with me suddenly without warning it must be the smell of the soap i put my face against the soft hair at the back of her neck and breathe her in baby powder and childs washed flesh and shampoo with an undertone the faint scent of urine this is the age she is when im in the bath she comes back to me at different ages this is how i know shes not really a ghost if she were a ghost she would be the same age always one day when she was eleven months old just before she began to walk a woman stole her out of a supermarket cart it was a saturday which was when luke and i did the weeks shopping because both of us had jobs she was sitting in the little baby seats they had then in supermarket carts with holes for the legs she was happy enough and id turned my back the cat loud section i think it was luke was over at the side of the store out of sight at the meat counter he liked to choose what kind of meant we were going to eat during the week he said men needed more meat than women did and that it wasnt a superstition and he wasnt being a jerk studies had been done there are some differences he said he was fond of saying that as if i was trying to prove there werent but mostly he said it when my mother was there he liked to tease her i heard her start to cry i turned around and she was disappearing down the aisle in the arms of a woman id never seen before i screamed and the woman was stopped she must have been about thirtyfive she was crying and saying it was her baby the lord had given it to her hed sent her a sign i felt sorry for her the store manager apologized and they held her until the police came shes just crazy luke said i thought it was an isolated incident at the time she fades i cant keep her here with me shes gone now maybe i do think of her as a ghost the ghost of a dead girl a little girl who died when she was five i remember the pictures of us i once had me holding herstandard poses mother and baby locked in a frame for safety behind my closed eyes i can see myself as i am now sitting beside an open drawer or a trunk in the cellar where the baby clothes are folded away a lock of hair cut when she was two in an envelope whiteblond it got darker later i dont have those things anymore the clothes and hair i wonder what happened to all our things looted dumped out carried away confiscated ive learned to do without a lot of things if you have a lot of things said aunt lydia you get too attached to this material world and you forget about spiritual values you must cultivate poverty of spirit blessed are the meek she didnt go on to say anything about inheriting the earth i lie lapped by the water beside an open drawer that does not exist and think about a girl who did not die when she was five who still does exist i hope though not for me do i exist for her am i a picture somewhere in the dark at the back of her mind they must have told her i was dead thats what they would think of doing they would say it would be easier for her to adjust eight she must be now ive filled in the time i lost i know how much theres been they were right its easier to think of her as dead i dont have to hope then or make a wasted effort why bash your head said aunt lydia against a wall sometimes she had a graphic way of putting things i aint got all day says coras voice outside the door its true she hasnt she hasnt got all of anything i must not deprive her of her time i soap myself use the scrub brush and the piece of pumice for sanding off dead skin such puritan aids are supplied i wish to be totally clean germless without bacteria like the surface of the moon i will not be able to wash myself this evening not afterwards not for a day it interferes they say and why take chances i cannot avoid seeing now the small tattoo on my ankle four digits and an eye a passport in reverse its supposed to guarantee that i will never be able to fade finally into another landscape i am too important too scarce for that i am a national resource i pull the plug dry myself put on my red terrycloth robe i leave todays dress here where cora will pick it up to be washed back in the room i dress again the white headdress isnt necessary for the evening because i wont be going out everyone in this house knows what my face looks like the red veil goes on though covering my damp hair my head which has not been shaved where did i see that film about the women kneeling in the town square hands holding them their hair falling in clumps what had they done it must have been a long time ago because i cant remember cora brings my supper covered on a tray she knocks at the door before entering i like her for that it means she thinks i have some of what we used to call privacy left thank you i say taking the tray from her and she actually smiles at me but she turns away without answering when were alone together shes shy of me i put the tray on the small whitepainted table and draw the chair up to it i take the cover off the tray the thigh of a chicken overcooked its better than bloody which is the other way she docs it rita has ways of making her resentments felt a baked potato green beans salad canned pears for dessert its good enough food though bland healthy food you have to get your vitamins and minerals said aunt lydia coyly you must be a worthy vessel no coffee or tea though no alcohol studies have been done theres a paper napkin as in cafeterias i think of the others those without this is the heartland here im leading a pampered life may the lord make us truly grateful said aunt lydia or was it thankful and i start to eat the food im not hungry tonight i feel sick to my stomach but theres no place to put the food no potted plants and i wont chance the toilet im too nervous thats what it is could i leave it on the plateask cora not to report me i chew and swallow chew and swallow feeling the sweat come out in my stomach the food balls itself together a handful of damp cardboard squeezed downstairs in the dining room there will be candles on the large mahogany table a white cloth silver flowers wine glasses with wine in them there will be the click of knives against china a clink as she sets down her fork with a barely audible sigh leaving half the contents of her plate untouched possibly she will say she has no appetite possibly she wont say anything if she says something does he comment if she doesnt say anything does he notice i wonder how she manages to get herself noticed i think it must be hard theres a pat of butter on the side of the plate i tear off a corner of the paper napkin wrap the butter in it take it to the cupboard and slip it into the toe of my right shoe from the extra pair as i have done before i crumple up the rest of the napkin no one surely will bother to smooth it out to check if any is missing i will use the butter later tonight it would not do this evening to smell of butter i wait i compose myself my self is a thing i must now compose as one composes a speech what i must present is a made thing not something born 15 the commander knocks at the door the knock is prescribed the sitting room is supposed to be serena joys territory hes supposed to ask permission to enter it she likes to keep him waiting its a little thing but in this household little things mean a lot tonight however she doesnt even get that because before serena joy can speak he steps forward into the room anyway maybe hes just forgotten the protocol but maybe its deliberate who knows what she said to him over the silverencrusted dinner table or didnt say the commander has on his black uniform in which he looks like a museum guard a semiretired man genial but wary killing time but only at first glance after that he looks like a midwestern bank president with his straight neatly brushed silver hair his sober posture shoulders a little stooped and after that there is his mustache silver also and after that his chin which really you cant miss when you get down as far as the chin he looks like a vodka ad in a glossy magazine of times gone by his manner is mild his hands large with thick fingers and acquisitive thumbs his blue eyes uncommunicative falsely innocuoushe looks us over as if taking inventory one kneeling woman in red one seated woman in blue two in green standing a solitary man thinfaced in the background he manages to appear puzzled as if he cant quite remember how we all got in here as if we are something he inherited like a victorian pump organ and he hasnt figured out what to do with us what we are worth he nods in the general direction of serena joy who does not make a sound he crosses to the large leather chair reserved for him takes the key out of his pocket fumbles with the ornate brassbound leathercovered box that stands on the table beside the chair he inserts the key opens the box lifts out the bible an ordinary copy with a black cover and goldedged pages the bible is kept locked up the way people once kept tea locked up so the servants wouldnt steal it it is an incendiary device who knows what wed make of it if we ever got our hands on it we can be read to from it by him but we cannot read our heads turn towards him we are expectant here comes our bedtime story the commander sits down and crosses his legs watched by us the bookmarks are in place he opens the book he clears his throat a little as if embarrassed could i have a drink of water he says to the air please he adds behind me one of them cora or rita leaves her space in the tableau and pads off towards the kitchen the commander sits looking down the commander sighs takes out a pair of reading glasses from his inside jacket pocket gold rims slips them on now he looks like a shoemaker in an old fairytale book is there no end to his disguises of benevolence we watch him every inch every flicker to be a man watched by women it must be entirely strange to have them watching him all the time to have them wondering whats he going to do next to have them flinch when he moves even if its a harmless enough move to reach for an ashtray perhaps to have them sizing him up to have them thinking he cant do it he wont do hell have to do this last as if he were a garment out of style or shoddy which must nevertheless be put on because theres nothing else available to have them putting him on trying him on trying him out while he himself puts them on like a sock over a tool onto the stub of himself his extra sensitive thumb his tentacle his delicate stalked slugs eye which extrudes expands winces and shrivels back into himself when touched wrongly grows big again bulging a little at the tip traveling forward as if along a leaf into them avid for vision to achieve vision in this way this journey into a darkness that is composed of women a woman who can see in darkness while he himself strains blindly forward she watches him from within were all watching him its the one thing we can really do and it is not for nothing if he were to falter fail or die what would become of us no wonder hes like a boot hard on the outside giving shape to a pulp of tenderfoot thats just a wish ive been watching him for some time and hes given no evidence of softness but watch out commander i tell him in my head ive got my eye on you one false move and im dead still it must be hell to be a man like that it must be just fine it must be hell it must be very silent the water appears the commander drinks it thank you he says cora rustles back into place the commander pauses looking down scanning the page he takes his time as if unconscious of us hes like a man toying with a steak behind a restaurant window pretending not to see the eyes watching him from hungry darkness not three feet from his elbow we lean towards him a little iron filings to his magnet he has something we dont have he has the word how we squandered it once the commander as if reluctantly begins to read he isnt very good at it maybe lies merely bored its the usual story the usual stories god to adam god to noah lie fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth then comes the moldy old rachel anil leah stuff we had drummed into us at the center give me children or else i die am i in gods stead who hath withheld from thee the fruit of the womb behold my maid bilhah she shall bear upon my knees that i may also have children by her and so on and so forth we had it read to us every breakfast as we sat in the high school cafeteria eating porridge with cream and brown sugar youre getting the best you know said aunt lydia theres a war on things are rationed you are spoiled girls she twinkled as if rebuking a kitten naughty puss for lunch it was the beatitudes blessed be this blessed be that they played it from a tape so not even an aunt would be guilty of the sin of reading the voice was a mans blessed be the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of heaven blessed are the merciful blessed be the meek blessed are the silent i knew they made that up i knew it was wrong and they left things out too but there was no way of checking blessed be those that mourn for they shall be comforted nobody said when i check the clock during dessert canned pears with cinnamon standard for lunch and look for moira in her place two tables over shes gone already i put my hand up i am excused we dont do this too often and always at different times of day in the washroom i go to the secondlast stall as usual are you there i whisper large as life and twice as ugly moira whispers back what have you heard i ask her nothing much ive got to get out of here im going bats i feel panic no no moira i say dont try it not on your own ill fake sick they send an ambulance ive seen it youll only get as far as the hospital at least itll be a change i wont have to listen to that old bitch theyll find you out not to worry im good at it when i was a kid in high school i cut out vitamin c i got scurvy in the early stages they cant diagnose it then you just start it again and youre fine ill hide my vitamin pills moira dont i couldnt stand the thought of her not being here with me for me they send two guys with you in the ambulance think about it they must be starved for it shit they arent even allowed to put their hands in their pockets the possibilities are you in there times up said the voice of aunt elizabeth from the doorway i stood up flushed the toilet two of moiras fingers appeared through the hole in the wall it was only large enough for two fingers i touched my own fingers to them quickly held on let go and leah said god hath given me my hire because i have given my maiden to my husband says the commander he lets the book fall closed it makes an exhausted sound like a padded door shutting by itself at a distance a puff of air the sound suggests the softness of the thin oniony pages how they would feel under the fingers soft and dry like papier poudre pink and powdery from the time before youd get it in booklets for taking the shine off your nose in those stores that sold candles and soap in the shapes of things seashells mushrooms like cigarette paper like prints the commander sits with his eyes closed for a moment as if tired he works long hours he has a lot of responsibilities sci cna has begun to cry i can hear her behind my back it isnt the first time she always does this the night of the ceremony shes trying not to make a noise shes trying to preserve her dignity in front of us the upholstery and the rugs muffle her but we ran hear her clearly despite that the tension between her lack of control and her attempt to suppress it is horrible its like a fart in church i feel as always the urge to laugh but not because i think its funny the smell of her crying spreads over us and we pretend to ignore it the commander opens his eyes notices frowns ceases to notice now we will have a moment of silent prayer says the commander we will ask for a blessing and for success in all our ventures i bow my head and close my eyes i listen to the held breath the almost inaudible gasps the shaking going on behind my back how she must hate me i think i pray silently nolite te bastardes carborundorum i dont know what it means but it sounds right and it will have to do because i dont know what else i can say to god not right now not as they used to say at this juncture the scratched writing on my cupboard wall floats before me left by an unknown woman with the face of moira i saw her go out to the ambulance on a stretcher carried by two angels what is it i mouthed to the woman beside me safe enough a question like that to all but a fanatic a fever she formed with her lips appendicitis they say i was having dinner that evening hamburger balls and hashed browns my table was near the window i could see out as far as the front gates i saw the ambulance come back no siren this time one of the angels jumped out talked with the guard the guard went into the building the ambulance stayed parked the angel stood with his back towards us as they had been taught to do two of the aunts came out of the building with the guard they went around to the back they hauled moira out dragged her in through the gate and up the front steps holding her under the armpits one on each side she was having trouble walking i stopped eating i couldnt eat by this time all of us on my side of the table were staring out the window the window was greenish with that chicken wire mesh they used to put inside glass aunt lydia said eat your dinner she went over and pulled down the blind they took her into the room that used to be the science lab it was a room where none of us ever went willingly afterwards she could not walk for a week her feet would not fit into her shoes they were too swollen it was the feet theyd do for a first offense they used steel cables frayed at the ends after that the hands they didnt care what they did to your feet or your hands even if it was permanent remember said aunt lydia for our purposes your feet and your hands are not essential moira lay on her bed an example she shouldnt have tried it not with the angels alma said from the next bed over we had to carry her to classes we stole extra paper packets of sugar for her from the cafeteria at mealtimes smuggled them to her at night handing them from bed to bed probably she didnt need the sugar but it was the only thing we could find to steal to give i am still praying but what i am seeing is moiras feet the way they looked after theyd brought her back her feet did not look like feet at all they looked like drowned feet swollen and boneless except for the color they looked like lungs oh god i pray nolite te bastardes carborundorum is this what you had in mind the commander clears his throat this is what he does to let us know dial in his opinion its time we stopped praying for the eyes of the lord run to and fro throughout the whole earth to know himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect towards him he says its the signoff he stands up we are dismissed4

you can clearly tell theres a genuine chemistry between the two even if you say this song blows  thats still a compliment it was so real jay was brought to tears while writing his verse18 rick ross ft big sean  kanye west sanctifiedross gruntfeaturing big sean and kanye west in addition to production by dj mustard and west sanctified was easily the most anticipated track from rozays 6th album mastermind while kanyes verse was a psa to the critics who continually attempt to tarnish his reputation ross rapped about grilled cheese and his rolls royce wraith not only did sanctified appear 1 on our top 10 beats of 2014 list but it served as the background music for the greatest viral video of all time17 ilovemakonnen ft drake tuesday remixi love makonnen began 2014 as a relatively unknown artist struggling to gain relevance as a musician and trying to break free from his manslaughter charges then one daydrizzy decided to drop a verse onto tuesday and nothing was the same makonnen sings about his drug dealing past and his busy schedule forcing him to bend the rules of when clubs can go up thanks to this single clubs will never be the same on a tuesday16 jcole 	wet dreamzover a classic sample cole gives us his vintage story telling as he reminisces about his first time with a girl he holds a cool attitude as tells the girl hes a pro  even though hes never had sex before as thing escalate further he watches porn videos for pointers and practices putting on a condom before the plot takes a twist right at the end whats scary is how well this song relates we guarantee almost every male listener felt some type of way 15 lil wayne ft drake believe me the release of believe me raised tha carter vs hype up few notches thanks to the perfect combination of ymcmbs finest drake lays down the hook and two stylistically different verses one that bounces perfectly with the boi1daproduced beat and another with a gritty flow wayne matches drake verseforverse and ends the track in memorable fashion one of the more underrated aspects of believe me is its versatility you can bump it while youre browsing genius driving to work or school or grinding through a workout it appeals to all ears just as we hope the entire album will14 schoolboy q break the bankcomplete with a chilling piano line and a mario kart 64 sample from the alchemist the instrumental is perfect for a modern gangster rapper like schoolboy q throughout the track he viciously reminds the listener that its his time and that he aint no one to fuck with with oxymoron debuting at number one on the billboard charts and having sold over 320000 copies it is safe to say that q is breaking the bank 13 aap rocky ft juicy j multiplyafter some uncharacteristic features aap returned with one of the hardest hitting songs of the year in multiply the flacko flow is on full display from the start his signature internal rhyming bounces up and down on the beat with such rhythm that it wouldnt matter if he used to sell crack or lemonade in his living room dont worry you wont be seeing an aap lemonade stand anytime soon as rocky sticks to his typical rapper and fashion references throw in some juicy j trash talk for good measure and aaps only single since longliveaap is one of the years best swag swag12 flying lotus ft kendrick lamar never catch melike a psychedelic rat race never catch me has kendrick lamar running circles around this flying lotus masterpiece the fusion of hip hop jazz  electronic styles has kendrick spazzing like a rabid dog the la natives take you on an outer body experience to stare death right in the face every few bars the instrumental changes as the race continues like kendricks searching for something getting faster and faster and as you reach your destination  bitch youre dead11 joey bada christ conscious toroidal flowwith an aggressive flow joey delivers a barrage of punchlines wordplay and utter energy that dazzles any listener the beauty of these lyrical acrobats continues to prolong joeys ability and shows he aint no slacker when it comes down to the lyrics dragon balls like his name was vegeata bada swears that no matter what he wont stop until he reaches the level of christ conscious10 run the jewels oh my darling dont cry anchored by an elp instrumental that can only be described as manic the dynamic duo laces the beat with rhymes that are crude insightful and simultaneously both what separates it from other rtj tracks is the erosion in differences between the styles and personalities of the lead rappers on rtj1 mike and el were characterized as aggressive and philosophical respectively but here el has no problem telling you to run backwards through a field of dicks as mike peruses egyptian scriptures the chemistry is palpable the flows are indescribable and the result is one of the highlights of 20149 rich gang ft birdman rich homie quan  young thug lifestyle euughblahbeahelgwlinahdewfqlfkqwfn lllllliiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiffffffffffeeeeeeeeeeeestyleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeefor a song that made many detractors reconsider rich homie quans onehit wonder status and mainstream listeners delve into the young thug archives the unintelligible nature of the lyrics for most listeners was its greatest asset whatever personal details you added over the beat you felt like your efforts were putting you on the fasttrack to a dionysian lifestyle of your own8 schoolboy q ft bj the chicago kid studioschoolboy q put his heart on his sleeve in this banger for the ladies elaborating on the reality that life as a major musician can be hectic from touring around the world to tv appearances to in this case late nights in the studio it can be hard to balance a relationship with a busy work schedule7 jcole fire squadif shock factor was what cole was after with fire squad then he certainly achieved it after boasting of his greatness in the first two verses he took an interesting approach highlighting white appropriation in the music of black culture not only did he just observe the soundjacking he name dropped some of the most wellknown artists to ever do it6 bobby shmurda hot niggathe relationship between artist and subject matter in the hiphop and rb genres especially is a dangerously liminal one when rick ross gets chastised for portraying a criminal mastermind following his career in law enforcement are we supposed to then turn around and congratulate bobby shmurda and his crew for their string of summer smashes for existing in a realm of authenticity it wasnt the lyrics nor the beat on its second goaround no less that made bobby so hot so when the chantworthy oneliners become appear as more than fiction should we cheer should we scold or should we shmoney dance the troubles away5 logic under pressurethe title track of the album is reminiscent of logics classic brag pieces entailing his recent rise in popularity and success where the initial fourminute release dropped off is the tracks elegant yet radical style shift  it transitions from his recent material success to a deeply introspective track reflecting on both his past and current state of affairs with family this track serves as the crown jewel of the album  a diamond created from being under pressure4 big sean ft e40 i dont fuck with yousean don and bay area godfather e40 went big this year with the anthem for those without fucks to give this track dropped along with paradise 4th quarter and jitjuke through his website following the announcement of his signing to roc nation the song samples say you love me as part of the exemplary accompaniment of coach kanye and dj mustard on the beat his blatantly vulgar lyrics clearly express his lack of interest in those he is not down with and is reminiscent of i dont give a fuck from bo while it has been confirmed that the record is not meant to be a shot to anyone in particular including naya rivera with whom he recently split the message is stillwho ever i dont fuck with i still dont fuck with you3 big krit	mt olympuspost krits 2013 release king remembered in time more verbal lightning from krizzle became high in demand and he delivered mt olympus sees krit punish all the heathens of the rap game showing them there really is a god the fans wonder is he rap is he snap is he bass is he drank neither  he is a king remembered in time2 drake 0100the catch upif theres one thing weve learned its that every song really does sound like drake featuring drake started from the bottom now we here may have been 2013s catchphrase but 0 to 100 nigga real quick took 2014 over almost as quickly as fans grabbed the free soundcloud download of this track after its june release the twopart track is a variety pack filled with braggadocio memeworthy lines and introspective thoughts what makes 0 to 100the catch up so notable is the instantaneous shift from straight fire bars to a calmer profession of the same sentiment drake is perched at the top of the rap game and hes only getting better thats a scary thought weve already begun to see drake back up these claims in his latest releases and its safe to say the anticipation for his next fulllength project is nearly off the charts1 kendrick lamar ibacked by funky production reminiscent of the wonder years of soul music kendrick broadcasts a message of self love the best messages are those easily understood and kendrick makes no mistakes with a simple i love myself similar to our number one song last year kanye wests new slaves every facet of the songs concept was handled in one spectacularly orchestrated move whether it be the record the music video or the buzz  each element illustrates the message crystal clear an anthem isnt created overnight this song has been in kendrick all his life they can lock ya body they cant trap ya mind 163

mexicano es uno de los tres símbolos patrios oficiales de méxico pese a conocerse y usarse como tal desde 1854 solo se hizo oficial desde 1943 a partir de un decreto expedido por el presidente manuel ávila camacho la letra del himno alude a victorias mexicanas en batallas y trata sobre la defensa de la patria sus estrofas y estribillo fueron compuestas por el poeta potosino francisco gonzález bocanegra en 1853 mientras que su música obra del músico español jaime nunó fue compuesta al año siguiente en su versión original el himno está compuesto por diez estrofas pero en los noventa años que pasó para su oficialización pasó por varias modificaciones o intentos de modificación quedando reducido solo a cuatro estrofas y el estribillo a partir de 1943 cuando fue oficializado características himno nacional mexicano vocal versión utilizada en radio y televisión problemas al reproducir este archivo las características y uso del himno nacional mexicano está regulada por la ley sobre el escudo la bandera y el himno nacionales en sus artículos 1 4 capítulo v de los artículos 38 a 49 y el capítulo especial de los artículos 57 a 60 y se menciona que el texto del himno y partitura de la música se encuentran autentificados por firma de los titulares de los poderes federales en una copia triple que se deposita para su resguardo en el archivo general de la nación en la biblioteca nacional y en el museo nacional de historia letra la letra oficial del himno mexicano se compone de cuatro estrofas y un estribillo como marca el artículo 57 de la citada ley y esas estrofas y estribillo son coro mexicanos al grito de guerra el acero aprestad y el bridón y retiemble en sus centros la tierra al sonoro rugir del cañón y retiemble en sus centros la tierra al sonoro rugir del

héroes la patria aquí fue x patria patria tus hijos te juran exhalar en tus aras su aliento si el clarín con su bélico acento los convoca a lidiar con valor para ti las guirnaldas de oliva un recuerdo para ellos de gloria un laurel para ti de victoria un sepulcro para ellos de honor oficialmente en 1943 el texto del himno nacional fue completamente publicado con sus diez estrofas y estribillo pero algunas se recortaron porque hacían referencia a santa anna por eso se recortó a solo cuatro estrofas que son las estrofas i v vi y x de la versión original y el estribillo la modificación de la letra fue ordenada primero por el presidente manuel ávila camacho pero solo se oficializó en 1984 por el presidente miguel de la madrid hurtado a las cuatro estrofas con el fin de hacerlo más fácil de interpretar música en el capítulo especial artículo 58 de la ley se presenta una copia de la partitura de la música del himno consistente básicamente en dos partes una para el estribillo y otra para las estrofas primera página de la partitura y letra segunda página de la partitura y letra interpretación la forma de interpretar el himno es como sigue estribillo estrofa i estribillo estrofa ii

parcialmente en actos solemnes de carácter oficial cívico cultural escolar o deportivo  en el caso de las versiones parciales indica que en planteles escolares y eventos deportivos tales como los juegos olímpicos las únicas partes del himno que pueden interpretarse o reproducirse son estribillo y estrofa i otras salvedades son para otros casos como los cierres y aperturas de trasmisiones de estaciones de radio o televisión pueden alterar dentro de las cuatro estrofas oficiales y previa autorización de la secretaría de gobernación la versión que transmiten aunque nunca pueden acortar las versiones completas que se producen durante ceremonias oficiales en ceremonias oficiales en territorio mexicano de instituciones públicas y privadas donde deba tocarse el himno nacional y otro extranjero se ejecutará en primer lugar el mexicano pero si existe un protocolo como en los juegos olímpicos se interpretará de acuerdo al orden que marque el protocolo correspondiente de ese acto por otro lado su uso como distintivo de honor se ejecuta acompañado de otra música por ejemplo para hacer honores al presidente de la república las bandas militares presentes tocarán la marcha de honor el caso de honores a la bandera las bandas de música ejecutarán el himno y a la vez las bandas militares tocarán la marcha llamada bandera y establece un límite a sus interpretaciones en ese caso dos veces para hacer honores a la bandera y rendir honores al presidente de la república aunque se indica la salvedad de que cuando sea interpretado por un coro las bandas militares deberán permanecer en silencio para apagar al coro en cualquier caso los presentes deberán demostrar el respecto asumiendo la posición de firme y en caso de que existan varones deben tener la cabeza descubierta salvedad que se hace con militares que disponen de un ceremonial propio uso en el extranjero en el extranjero las embajadas consulados y legaciones oficiales de la secretaria de relaciones exteriores son las encargadas de la vigilancia de la aplicación de la ley y el respeto al himno nacional evitando su uso comercial y autorizando su interpretación previa consulta con la secretaría de gobernación en situaciones que no sean actos cívicos además de promover su interpretación en actos públicos solemnes realizados por mexicanos además tiene la obligación de solicitar ante el gobierno que está acreditado que prohíba su uso sobre todo si es de carácter comercial en otros idiomas en méxico hay personas que conservan y hablan exclusivamente lenguas indígenas o propias de su cultura de origen desde el 8 de diciembre de 2005 el artículo 39 de la ley permite la traducción de la letra a las lenguas nativas la traducción debe ser sancionada por el instituto nacional de lenguas indígenas y autorizada por la secretaría de gobernación hasta 2014 el himno nacional ha sido traducido a las siguientes lenguas indígenas chinanteco otomí mixteco maya náhuatl y huasteco otros grupos nativos han traducido el himno a sus respectivas lenguas pero no ha sido sancionado por el gobierno fuera de las lenguas nativas ha sido traducido al bajo alemán plautdietsch niños y jóvenes menonitas de méxico entonan el himno nacional mexicano traducido al alemán dentro de sus colegios cada lunes en 2008 resultó ganador a nivel estatal un colegio menonita llamado la esperanza del municipio chihuahuense de cuauhtémoc quienes entonaron el himno nacional mexicano en español y una estrofa en su idioma materno enseñanza y difusión desde 2005 es una obligación la enseñanza del himno nacional en todos los planteles de educación prescolar primaria y secundaria en el país para lograr eso desde ese año se organiza un concurso nacional de interpretación del himno por coros infantiles vigilancia en méxico la secretaría de gobernación es la encargada de la vigilancia de la aplicación de la ley aunque se puede ayudar de las demás oficinas del gobierno federal como el caso de la secretaría de relaciones exteriores para otras naciones o la secretaría de educación pública para el caso de la difusión y enseñanza importancia cultural aficionados mexicanos interpretando el himno nacional antes de un partido de fútbol tras la escritura del himno méxico seguía enfrentándose a los efectos de una derrota en una guerra con estados unidos el país se sentía desmoralizado y también dividido debido a la pérdida de aproximadamente la mitad de su territorio el cual le pertenecía ya a estados unidos de acuerdo con el historiador javier garciadiego quien habló en una ceremonia conmemorativa del 150º aniversario de la aprobación del himno en 2004 el himno hace caso omiso a las divisiones y conflictos y anima la unidad nacional en esa misma fecha la ciudad de méxico y otras partes del país detuvieron lo que hacían e interpretaron un canto del himno a nivel nacional individuos de otras naciones participaron también mayoritariamente en las oficinas diplomáticas o en lugares donde se encontraban una alta concentración de expatriados de méxico el himno también ha sido descrito como uno de los símbolos de la identidad mexicana antes de 1820 entre los pueblos prehispánicos no se tiene noticia de que existiera al menos algo parecido a un himno que se identificara unívocamente a algunos de los altépetl pero al llegar las tradiciones europeas tras la llamada conquista española florecieron los llamados himnos religiosos en cuyas letras y música alababan la vida de algún santo o la deidad de la iglesia católica así como los himnos cívicos que trataban de alabar la llegada de virreyes de obispos clérigos la entronización de reyes españoles y más comúnmente la vida de algún personaje o grupo novohispano de entre los autores más destacados de ese tipo de himnos tenemos a manuel de sumaya josé de torres y josé aldana cuya obra religiosa fue profusamente elogiadas en su tiempo y aún hoy destacan de toda su obra los himnos dedicados a la virgen de guadalupe la primera vez que existió en méxico algo muy parecido a un himno nacional fue la llamada marcha real o marcha granadera que desde 1761 se empezó a usar en españa y sus colonias durante las ceremonias cívicas autoría de manuel de espinosa de los monteros fue una obra de cierto agrado que influyo en los años posteriores en el nuevo nacionalismo mexicano que se formó durante la guerra de independencia siglo xix al consumarse la independencia de méxico en 1821 el nuevo nacionalismo mexicano solo impulsó la creación de un escudo y bandera nacional como símbolo del nuevo estado al parecer la idea de un himno nacional no era una necesidad por eso durante la entronización de agustín de iturbide se cantó el himno religioso veni creator en forma especial posteriormente el protocolo de toma del cargo para el primer presidente y vicepresidente de méxico no incluyó ningún himno o canción usada como un himno a pesar de eso durante ese primer medio siglo nunca faltaron propuestas informales de himnos que trataron de tomar el lugar por ejemplo durante la etapa final de la guerra de independencia se realizó un sitio a la ciudad de querétaro por parte de tropas trigarantes entre esas tropas se encontraba un músico llamado josé torrescano quien compuso un himno muy anti español cuya frase más cuestionada era somos independientesviva la libertadviva américa librey viva la igualdad por eso no fue muy promovido el himno ya que la idea del ejército trigarante era lograr la unidad de todos los grupos sociales de la nueva españa ya en lo que se considera el méxico independiente en 1822 otro músico de nombre josé maría garmendía realizó otro himno que no gustó por estar muy centrado en la figura de agustín de iturbide por ejemplo sus primeras palabras eran a las armas valientes indianosa las armas corred con valorel partido seguid de iturbideseamos libres y no haya opresión por eso al cambiar de régimen monárquico a republicano este fue totalmente olvidado luego durante las república tanto federalista como centralista cuando se querían hacer honores al presidente o vicepresidente se interpretaba alguna pieza de su agrado por ejemplo antonio lópez de santa anna gustaba de la obertura semiramis de gioachino rossini mientras josé joaquín de herrera prefería poeta y campesino de franz von suppé el 13 de julio de 1844 otro músico de nombre musicalizó un poema anónimo que honraba a antonio lópez de santa anna quien estaba en su 8º periodo de gobierno durante la república centralista este no gustó al público y terminó olvidado en 1849 luego de la desastrosa guerra mexicanaestadounidense de 1846 a 1848 y durante la presidencia federal de josé joaquín de herrera se formó una llamada junta patriótica de la ciudad de méxico que a través de la academia de san juan de letrán organizó un concurso para buscar una letra que junto a la música del pianista austriaco henri herz pudiera formar un himno nacional ese primer concurso fue la propuesta más seria hasta el momento incluía entre sus jueces a personajes muy destacados de la época como andrés quintana roo manuel lacunza josé joaquín pesado manuel carpio y alejandro arango y escandón el concurso fue ganado por el estadounidense andrés david bradburn lo cual junto con el contenido de la obra hizo que fuera un verdadero fracaso que terminó por olvidarse poco después en 1850 la misma academia de san juan de letrán realizó su propio concurso para musicalizar un poema del cubano juan miguel lozada la música seleccionada fue obra de nicoláscharles bochsa pero al ser un poema muy centrado en la figura del presidente josé joaquín de herrera no trascendió al parecer durante ese año se dio una especie de competencia informal ya que el músico italiano antonio barilli propuso no solo un himno propuso dos los cuales de ninguna manera fueron del agrado del pueblo mexicano poco después en 1851 otro músico de origen checo max maretzek presentó su propuesta y no fructificó y así se fueron acumulando en tan solo tres años varios intentos en abril de 1853 el italiano inocencio pellegrini presentó su canto nacional sin mucho éxito si es que tuvo alguno en diciembre de 1853 otro músico de apellido infante creó una composición patriótica dedicada a antonio lópez de santa anna la cual solo se tocó una noche otras personalidades que presentaron propuestas formales e informales fueron fernando calderón y beltrán josé maría garmendia francisco manuel sánchez de tagle mariano elízaga y josé maría heredia competencia oficial no se sabe si debido a esa efervescencia o solo por el gusto del entonces presidente y dictador antonio lópez de santa anna el 12 de noviembre de 1853 por medio del diario oficial del gobierno de la república mexicana se dio a conocer un doble concurso cuyo fin y orden seria seleccionar un poema patriótico y su musicalización posterior para formar un himno a la patria  en 1854 se celebraría el 25 aniversario de la victoria de tampico de 1829 cuando antonio lópez de santa anna venció al ejército español en su intento de reconquista buscó santa anna festejar por todo lo alto su gran victoria militar donde alcanzó el rango de general de división el concurso se convocó con la anticipación debida para que el 11 de septiembre del siguiente año se tuviera el himno nacional arreglado para la letra se solicitaba enviar la propuesta en sobre cerrado con un seudónimo al ministerio de fomento colonización industria y comercio en menos de veinte días tras lo cual se tardarían diez días para definir al ganador luego de darse a conocer al ganador la musicalización tendría otro mes para recibir propuestas tras lo cual se tardaría un mes más para dar a conocer al ganador de la música en la misma convocatoria se definía que los derechos de explotación de las propuestas pasarían a manos del gobierno central y solo se entregaría una contraprestación a los ganadores esta convocatoria fue firmada por el entonces oficial mayor del ministerio miguel lerdo de tejada el jurado para la letra estuvo formado por josé bernardo couto manuel carpio y josé joaquín pesado mientras el jurado para la música se integró por josé antonio gómez agustín balderas y tomás león el resultado para la letra se publicó el 4 de febrero de 1854 en el diario oficial junto a la letra siendo ganador el potosino francisco gonzález bocanegra quien luego se supiera realizó la letra encerrado en una habitación por la que era entonces su prometida guadalupe gonzález del pino ya que él no quería participar en el concurso gonzález fue anunciado el ganador en el diario oficial del gobierno de la república mexicana del 3 de febrero de 1854 si bien el himno de gonzález bocanegra es un himno de corte bélico no lo es de ataque agresión ó expansionismo sino todo lo contrario es un himno de defensa de la patria y del territorio nacional seguramente inspirado en el evento militar que se recordaba y festejaba ese año de 1854 al cumplirse 25 años de la invasión española de reconquista el poeta narra en sus estrofas la situación y disposición de los mexicanos y la nación ante una invasión extranjera no así para una guerra intestina y fratricida santa anna el gran vencedor de tampico sería recordado en ese himno santanista que incluso le fue obsequiado por gonzález bocanegra en la dedicatoria la misma noche de su estreno en el gran teatro de santa anna el himno reseña una gran victoria militar contra un extraño enemigo es decir una nación extranjera la única gran victoria con esas características que se celebraba en méxico en esa época era la obtenida en tampico en 1829  como decía la convocatoria tras darse a conocer al ganador de la letra se abrió el concurso de la música se realizó como se decía en un mes siendo ganadora la obra del músico italiano giovanni bottesini pero simplemente no gusto además fue acusado de musicalizar y dar a conocer por fuera del concurso su propuesta lo cual era contrario a los términos del concurso debido a eso el concurso se prolongó hasta los ciento ochenta días mientras el 18 de mayo de 1854 estreno formalmente su propuesta en el teatro santa anna con las voces de la soprano enriqueta sontag y el tenor gaspar pozzolini pero aun así no fue del agrado del público en general tras esa prolongación a ciento ochenta días fue la propuesta del músico español jaime nunó roca la que ganó por entonces nunó era director de las bandas militares del ejército nacional ese puesto lo había logrado por invitación de antonio lópez de santa anna quien lo había conocido en uno de sus varios exilios en cuba su obra con el seudónimo dios y libertad fue declarada ganadora el 12 de agosto de 1854 por medio del diario oficial del gobierno de la república mexicana el himno fue aceptado el día de la independencia del mismo año la interpretación inaugural fue dirigida por giovanni bottesini cantado por claudia florenti y lorenzo salvi en el teatro santa anna poco más de un mes después la noche del 15 de septiembre de 1854 fue interpretado públicamente por primera vez el himno en el entonces famoso teatro santa anna que por entonces cerraba al poniente la calle que hoy se llama 5 de mayo en el hoy llamado centro histórico de la ciudad de méxico que en aquella época era lo único que se llamaba ciudad de méxico luego de algunas palabras del poeta francisco gonzález bocanegra se interpretó el himno dirigido por giovanni bottesini y las voces de claudina florentini lorenzo salvi y coros del teatro a cargo de rené masón y pedro carvajal esa primera vez no fue el estreno oficial ya que solo hasta el día siguiente fue cuando antonio lópez de santa anna en su carácter de presidente asistió a su interpretación por parte de balbina steffenone y lorenzo salvi al contrario de todos los intentos anteriores su éxito fue casi inmediato y su partitura se vendió en las calles su rechazo y aceptación pero no duro mucho su fortuna el 9 de agosto de 1855 antonio lópez de santa anna deja la presidencia por última vez y abandona méxico jaime nunó le sigue a la habana y luego se pierde en los eeuu a la vez francisco gonzález bocanegra se esconde en casa de un tío para evitar represalias y no vuelve ponerse a descubierto del público muere de tifo el 11 de abril de 1861 a sus 37 años la causa de ese repentino cambio es por la llamada revolución de ayutla que desde el 1 de marzo de 1854 venia impulsando un cambio de gobierno federalista y liberal por la revolución de ayutla los grupos liberales y federalistas se hacen del poder e inicia la llamada época de la reforma que traería personajes como benito juárez melchor ocampo ignacio ramírez miguel lerdo de tejada guillermo prieto juan n álvarez e ignacio comonfort como eran contrarios a santa anna hicieron lo posible para que se olvidara el himno santanista si bien no lo prohibieron de ninguna manera alentaron su interpretación pero poco a poco el himno fue ganando adeptos por ejemplo al final de la guerra de reforma cuando las tropas federales retomaban la ciudad de méxico el gral liberal florencio maría del castillo relata que la comitiva se detuvo frente al primer arco para escuchar el himno cuya letra sentimos no haber conseguido terminado el himno fue entonada la marsellesa esa marcha que conmueve los corazones de todos los pueblos y la multitud repitió el estribillo de lo anterior se puede ampliar que hasta la llamada segunda intervención francesa el himno más popular en méxico entre los liberales y muchos otros grupos era la marsellesa y que aun durante la guerra en el segundo imperio mexicano era el himno preferido por benito juárez para ser tocado en su presencia como presidente de méxico otro himno muy popular aunque no fue escrito como tal fue obra de guillermo prieto quien la había escrito como poema satírico en 1853 apareció en su libro de 1854 viajes de orden suprema ese poema musicalizado había sido presentado al concurso santanista por guillermo prieto a través de un tercero y titulada la marcha de los cangrejos obviamente no ganó pero para 1864 al inicio del segundo imperio mexicano ya era una de las canciones más populares en méxico al punto de que el propio emperador maximiliano solicitó que se tocara en su presencia durante una visita a la ciudad de guanajuato en 1864 como una manera de congraciarse con los liberales pero el efecto fue un severo susto e indignación de los grupos conservadores y monárquicos que lo apoyaron para llegar al trono de ese himno informal melchor ocampo cuenta que los cangrejos convertidos en himno popular formulaban el regocijo y el orden y la concordia embellecían un día que lo sobreponen en grandeza a la recepción del ejército trigarantesic otra obra que llegó a ser muy popular y usada como himno fue adiós mamá carlota que solo por su letra no terminó por oficializarse en todo caso al final de la guerra y con la república restaurada el himno santanista volvió a tener presencia si no es que la tuvo durante toda la guerra aunque con varias modificaciones por ejemplo en 1864 el presidente benito juárez discutió con varios sobre ciertas modificaciones a la letra le sugerían suprimir la referencia al guerrero inmortal de zempoala a lo que contesto al himno nacional no se le quita ni una sola nota ni una sola palabra otro cambio que sí perduró fue en la séptima estrofa cambiando si a la lid contra estado enemigo por si a la lid contra hueste enemiga además de muchas otras que no perduraron tras esa época llegó la presidencia de sebastián lerdo de tejada hermano de quien siendo oficial mayor firmó la convocatoria al concurso de 1853 al parecer desde ese momento se impulsó el uso del himno santanista aunque con modificaciones tras la caída de su gobierno por el plan de tuxtepec el nuevo presidente porfirio díaz empezó a usar el himno santanista de común para las ceremonias oficiales siglo xx en 1901 es redescubierto por decirlo de alguna manera el compositor jaime nunó un grupo de mexicanos que estaban de viaje por estados unidos lo encuentra en la ciudad de buffalo nueva york lo dan a conocer al presidente y este lo invita a visitar méxico acepta y durante su visita por primera vez dirige orquesta y coros para interpretar el himno mexicano pero su visita no resulta cálida y regresa a nueva york para entonces era ciudadano estadounidense en 1904 vuelve a ser invitado con motivo de los cincuenta años del himno con mucho más éxito que la visita anterior esa fue la última vez que vivo tocó suelo mexicano ya que muere el 18 de julio de 1908 en bay city nueva jersey durante su primera visita el 11 de febrero de 1901 tras una sesión solemne se anunció que el congreso de la unión concedía a jaime nunó y gonzález bocanegra la cantidad de dos mil pesos de entonces como contraprestación y premio por el concurso de 1853 por parte de gonzález bocanegra el dinero fue recibido por mercedes serralde de gonzález bocanegra como heredera del poeta además a nunó se le dieron los 388 pesos que puso de su bolsillo para hacer la primera tirada de la partitura en 1854 lo cual él ratificó en una entrevista al diario el imparcial del 9 de julio de 1901 durante las celebraciones del centenario de la independencia se vuelve normal el uso del himno santanista y se le empieza a llamar corrientemente como himno nacional méxicano durante la revolución mexicana ya tiene el sello de aprobación popular y oficial pero sin una reglamentación clara se interpreta con las estrofas a gusto del intérprete aunque algunas ya se destacan entre las diez cuatro de ellas en concreto para la llamada guerra cristera incluso se usa por parte del gobierno anticlerical la segunda estrofa que dice de la paz el arcángel divinoque en el cielo tu eterno destinopor el dedo de dios se escribió la primera vez que se grabó el himno en un medio sonoro fue el 28 de julio de 1922 por la cantante duranguense fanny anitúa su versión al decir de muchos fue deficiente y modificada lo que causó gran polémica al grado de requerir una revisión oficial por parte del consejo cultural del distrito federal la revisión fue llevada a cabo por josé lópez portillo y rojas manuel barajas y julián carrillo durante esta revisión se conoció la pérdida de los textos originales entonces el grupo recurrió a la familia de gonzález bocanegra quienes entregaron originales del estribillo y las estrofas también se consiguió una primera edición del himno bajo el sello de la casa murguía en 1854 por otra parte una de las familias pudientes de la época identificada como pérez salas obsequió una instrumentación del himno que el mismo jaime nunó envió a la plana mayor del ejército nacional y a la dirección general de artillería uno de los que pagó con 388 pesos esa revisión demostró los varios cambios que había sufrido el himno así como la dificultad de interpretarlo completo por eso se empezó a limitar el número de estrofas pero sin seguir una formalidad por eso el 4 de mayo de 1943 el entonces presidente de méxico manuel ávila camacho durante la participación de méxico en la segunda guerra mundial promulgó un decreto que oficializaba el himno y lo limitaba a las estrofas i v vi y x más el estribillo por ese decreto se prohibió alterar corregir o modificar la letra o la música ese decreto se formalizó aún más y conjugó con los otros símbolos patrios el 23 de diciembre de 1967 por la ley sobre las características y el uso del escudo la bandera y el himno nacionales ley que fue suprimida en 1984 por la ley sobre el escudo la bandera y el himno nacionales la cual es el ordenamiento que la rige hasta hoy controversias derechos de autor en 1959 la sociedad repertorio wagner s a publicó una partitura para que se pudiera interpretar el himno nacional mexicano por parte de las bandas civiles de música el decreto de 1943 no tenía una partitura anexa y debía conseguirse aparte además de que no era fácil duplicar el decreto esa publicación levantó varios gritos de histeria y terror entre el pueblo mexicano ya que varios periódicos difundieron la supuesta noticia de que wagner era propietaria o se hacía pasar por propietaria del himno nacional debido a eso por ejemplo se dijo que cada lunes los estudiantes debían dar un peso a su escuela para poder interpretar el himno lo que a todas luces es falso de esta manera durante toda su vida el himno ha estado por decirlo ligeramente lleno de bromas de mal gusto incluso en la era del internet como ejemplo de ello está el rumor de que la casa wagner y levien registró el himno nacional mexicano y que por eso cobraba los derechos de ejecución declarándose propietaria de la obra a nivel internacional situación similar pasa en los eeuu con la casa ralph s perr y compañía pero por más desmentido oficial que hace el gobierno mexicano aún sigue el mito en septiembre de 1959 luego de poner una multa a la casa wagner se realizó una investigación para dilucidar si el rumor de que la familia de jaime nunó había vendido los derechos del autor a una casa musical en los eeuu de la investigación se determinó que no existió tal venta de sus derechos de explotación y menos sus derechos de autor aunque luego se encontró que el mismo jaime nunó había vendido en la década de 1850 sus derechos de explotación efectivamente a una casa de música estadounidense pero solo de un arreglo a la música del himno un arreglo para tocar el himno al piano ese arreglo además estaba en otro ritmo y tenor por lo que era muy diferente a la versión original además para 1960 ya habían pasado los cien años que protegía la legislación estadounidense los derechos de explotación y por la misma legislación al ser una obra anterior a 1909 no le aplicaba la ley vigente en 1953 antes de 1909 no existía ley en eeuu que protegiera eso en último caso no transcendía su ley fuera de sus fronteras otra versión de la venta de los derechos de jaime nunó es como sigue el propio nunó y dos estadounidenses harry henneman y phil hill registraron la música de nuñó con la empresa bmi edward b marks music company fue entonces la editora del himno en los eeuu en 1910 y 1911 por lo que luego de encontrarse con las publicaciones de esa casa editorial varios mexicanos empezaron a propagar el rumor sobre que esa casa comercial era la dueña de los derechos de autor no obstante la ley de los derechos de autor en estados unidos declara que el himno mexicano está en el dominio público dentro de los estados unidos dado que tanto la letra como la música fueron estrenadas antes de 1909 además bajo la ley de derechos de autor en méxico el artículo 155 expone que el gobierno tiene los derechos morales pero no el derecho de autor del himno además de que también en méxico está en dominio público ya que se cumplieron los cien años establecidos para su liberación desde el 2008 himno bélico otra polémica muy habitual se basa en que la letra del himno es muy bélica por ejemplo se dice que el estribillo llama a la guerra mexicanos al grito de guerra por lo que varias veces se ha propuesto modificar o cambiar de plano el himno incluso en tiempos recientes el poeta javier sicilia en una entrevista sobre la caravana con justicia y dignidad a la pregunta de también lo preguntaba por el lábaro patrio porque he visto que te molesta el belicismo del himno nacional de méxico respondió sicilia cuando han intentado cantar el himno en el templete de las caravanas yo digo no habría que cambiarlo si lo escuchamos es el problema de no atender a las palabras el himno justifica la guerra necesitamos cambiar la letra esa letra no nos representa fue de un momento histórico y no es el que vivimos estamos en la búsqueda de la paz del amor del reconocimiento de lo humano por encima de las fronteras y nacionessic esa polémica básicamente se ve en personajes de la izquierda mexicana como lo es sicilia es un himno de la derecha en forma paralela sobre el tema belicista del himno esta la polémica sobre su origen santanista ya que antonio lópez de santa anna es uno si no el más odiado personaje de la historia mexicana sobre todo se recuerda su participación en la guerra mexicanaestadounidense y en la guerra texana los principales defensores de esta polémica están en la llamada izquierda mientras los llamados políticos de derecha normalmente defienden el himno como una obra propia de su tiempo que ha ganado su lugar en la historia y estima del pueblo como refuerzo del rechazo al himno se marca su estilo musical conocido como quinta real por su parecido con la marcha real una marcha militar que desde 1791 se usa como himno de españa cine en 1943 cuando se oficializó el himno se estrenó la película mexicanos al grito de guerra dirigida por álvaro gálvez y fuentes e ismael rodríguez y protagonizada por pedro infante y lina montes cuya trama básica es la supuesta historia del himno nacional hasta la batalla del 5 de mayo en puebla en la parte final se muestra a los soldados mexicanos cantando el himno para darse valor pero ningún documento histórico ha podido respaldar esa escena el segundo durante décadas se ha dicho e incluso medios de comunicación han informado que el himno nacional mexicano es considerado el segundo más bello del mundo detrás de la marsellesa pero hasta el día de hoy no se ha llevado a cabo ningún tipo de concurso o competición arbitrada que avale ese dicho incluso es común oír este mito aplicado a otros himnos nacionales como por ejemplo el ecuatoriano colombiano peruano inglés estadounidense etc versión original versión

nombre no quiero acordarme no ha mucho tiempo que vivía un hidalgo de los de lanza en astillero adarga antigua rocín flaco y galgo corredor una olla de algo más vaca que carnero salpicón las más noches duelos y quebrantos los sábados lantejas los viernes algún palomino de añadidura los domingos consumían las tres partes de su hacienda el resto della concluían sayo de velarte calzas de velludo para las fiestas con sus pantuflos de lo mesmo y los días de entresemana se honraba con su vellorí de lo más fino tenía en su casa una ama que pasaba de los cuarenta y una sobrina que no llegaba a los veinte y un mozo de campo y plaza que así ensillaba el rocín como tomaba la podadera frisaba la edad de nuestro hidalgo con los cincuenta años era de complexión recia seco de carnes enjuto de rostro gran madrugador y amigo de la caza quieren decir que tenía el sobrenombre de quijada o quesada que en esto hay alguna diferencia en los autores que deste caso escriben aunque por conjeturas verosímiles se deja entender que se llamaba quejana pero esto importa poco a nuestro cuento basta que en la narración dél no se salga un punto de la verdad es pues de saber que este sobredicho hidalgo los ratos que estaba ocioso que eran los más del año se daba a leer libros de caballerías con tanta afición y gusto que olvidó casi de todo punto el ejercicio de la caza y aun la administración de su hacienda y llegó a tanto su curiosidad y desatino en esto que vendió muchas hanegas de tierra de sembradura para comprar libros de caballerías en que leer y así llevó a su casa todos cuantos pudo haber dellos y de todos ningunos le parecían tan bien como los que compuso el famoso feliciano de silva porque la claridad de su prosa y aquellas entricadas razones suyas le parecían de perlas y más cuando llegaba a leer aquellos requiebros y cartas de desafíos donde en muchas partes hallaba escrito la razón de la sinrazón que a mi razón se hace de tal manera mi razón enflaquece que con razón me quejo de la vuestra fermosura y también cuando leía los altos cielos que de vuestra divinidad divinamente con las estrellas os fortifican y os hacen merecedora del merecimiento que merece la vuestra grandeza con estas razones perdía el pobre caballero el juicio y desvelábase por entenderlas y desentrañarles el sentido que no se lo sacara ni las entendiera el mesmo aristóteles si resucitara para sólo ello no estaba muy bien con las heridas que don belianís daba y recebía porque se imaginaba que por grandes maestros que le hubiesen curado no dejaría de tener el rostro y todo el cuerpo lleno de cicatrices y señales pero con todo alababa en su autor aquel acabar su libro con la promesa de aquella inacabable aventura y muchas veces le vino deseo de tomar la pluma y dalle fin al pie de la letra como allí se promete y sin duda alguna lo hiciera y aun saliera con ello si otros mayores y continuos pensamientos no se lo estorbaran tuvo muchas veces competencia con el cura de su lugar que era hombre docto graduado en sigüenza sobre cuál había sido mejor caballero palmerín de ingalaterra o amadís de gaula mas maese nicolás barbero del mesmo pueblo decía que ninguno llegaba al caballero del febo y que si alguno se le podía comparar era don galaor hermano de amadís de gaula porque tenía muy acomodada condición para todo que no era caballero melindroso ni tan llorón como su hermano y que en lo de la valentía no le iba en zaga en resolución él se enfrascó tanto en su letura que se le pasaban las noches leyendo de claro en claro y los días de turbio en turbio y así del poco dormir y del mucho leer se le secó el celebro de manera que vino a perder el juicio llenósele la fantasía de todo aquello que leía en los libros así de encantamentos como de pendencias batallas desafíos heridas requiebros amores tormentas y disparates imposibles y asentósele de tal modo en la imaginación que era verdad toda aquella máquina de aquellas sonadas soñadas invenciones que leía que para él no había otra historia más cierta en el mundo decía él que el cid ruy díaz había sido muy buen caballero pero que no tenía que ver con el caballero de la ardiente espada que de sólo un revés había partido por medio dos fieros y descomunales gigantes mejor estaba con bernardo del carpio porque en roncesvalles había muerto a roldán el encantado valiéndose de la industria de hércules cuando ahogó a anteo el hijo de la tierra entre los brazos decía mucho bien del gigante morgante porque con ser de aquella generación gigantea que todos son soberbios y descomedidos él solo era afable y bien criado pero sobre todos estaba bien con reinaldos de montalbán y más cuando le veía salir de su castillo y robar cuantos topaba y cuando en allende robó aquel ídolo de mahoma que era todo de oro según dice su historia diera él por dar una mano de coces al traidor de galalón al ama que tenía y aun a su sobrina de añadidura en efeto rematado ya su juicio vino a dar en el más estraño pensamiento que jamás dio loco en el mundo y fue que le pareció convenible y necesario así para el aumento de su honra como para el servicio de su república hacerse caballero andante y irse por todo el mundo con sus armas y caballo a buscar las aventuras y a ejercitarse en todo aquello que él había leído que los caballeros andantes se ejercitaban deshaciendo todo género de agravio y poniéndose en ocasiones y peligros donde acabándolos cobrase eterno nombre y fama imaginábase el pobre ya coronado por el valor de su brazo por lo menos del imperio de trapisonda y así con estos tan agradables pensamientos llevado del estraño gusto que en ellos sentía se dio priesa a poner en efeto lo que deseaba y lo primero que hizo fue limpiar unas armas que habían sido de sus bisabuelos que tomadas de orín y llenas de moho luengos siglos había que estaban puestas y olvidadas en un rincón limpiólas y aderezólas lo mejor que pudo pero vio que tenían una gran falta y era que no tenían celada de encaje sino morrión simple mas a esto suplió su industria porque de cartones hizo un modo de media celada que encajada con el morrión hacían una apariencia de celada entera es verdad que para probar si era fuerte y podía estar al riesgo de una cuchillada sacó su espada y le dio dos golpes y con el primero y en un punto deshizo lo que había hecho en una semana y no dejó de parecerle mal la facilidad con que la había hecho pedazos y por asegurarse deste peligro la tornó a hacer de nuevo poniéndole unas barras de hierro por de dentro de tal manera que él quedó satisfecho de su fortaleza y sin querer hacer nueva experiencia della la diputó y tuvo por celada finísima de encaje fue luego a ver su rocín y aunque tenía más cuartos que un real y más tachas que el caballo de gonela que tantum pellis et ossa fuit le pareció que ni el bucéfalo de alejandro ni babieca el del cid con él se igualaban cuatro días se le pasaron en imaginar qué nombre le pondría porque según se decía él a sí mesmo no era razón que caballo de caballero tan famoso y tan bueno él por sí estuviese sin nombre conocido y ansí procuraba acomodársele de manera que declarase quién había sido antes que fuese de caballero andante y lo que era entonces pues estaba muy puesto en razón que mudando su señor estado mudase él también el nombre y le cobrase famoso y de estruendo como convenía a la nueva orden y al nuevo ejercicio que ya profesaba y así después de muchos nombres que formó borró y quitó añadió deshizo y tornó a hacer en su memoria e imaginación al fin le vino a llamar rocinante nombre a su parecer alto sonoro y significativo de lo que había sido cuando fue rocín antes de lo que ahora era que era antes y primero de todos los rocines del mundo puesto nombre y tan a su gusto a su caballo quiso ponérsele a sí mismo y en este pensamiento duró otros ocho días y al cabo se vino a llamar don quijote de donde como queda dicho tomaron ocasión los autores desta tan verdadera historia que sin duda se debía de llamar quijada y no quesada como otros quisieron decir pero acordándose que el valeroso amadís no sólo se había contentado con llamarse amadís a secas sino que añadió el nombre de su reino y patria por hepila famosa y se llamó amadís de gaula así quiso como buen caballero añadir al suyo el nombre de la suya y llamarse don quijote de la mancha con que a su parecer declaraba muy al vivo su linaje y patria y la honraba con tomar el sobrenombre della limpias pues sus armas hecho del morrión celada puesto nombre a su rocín y confirmándose a sí mismo se dio a entender que no le faltaba otra cosa sino buscar una dama de quien enamorarse porque el caballero andante sin amores era árbol sin hojas y sin fruto y cuerpo sin alma decíase él a sí si yo por malos de mis pecados o por mi buena suerte me encuentro por ahí con algún gigante como de ordinario les acontece a los caballeros andantes y le derribo de un encuentro o le parto por mitad del cuerpo o finalmente le venzo y le rindo no será bien tener a quien enviarle presentado y que entre y se hinque de rodillas ante mi dulce señora y diga con voz humilde y rendido yo señora soy el gigante caraculiambro señor de la ínsula malindrania a quien venció en singular batalla el jamás como se debe alabado caballero don quijote de la mancha el cual me mandó que me presentase ante vuestra merced para que la vuestra grandeza disponga de mí a su talante oh cómo se holgó nuestro buen caballero cuando hubo hecho este discurso y más cuando halló a quien dar nombre de su dama y fue a lo que se cree que en un lugar cerca del suyo había una moza labradora de muy buen parecer de quien él un tiempo anduvo enamorado aunque según se entiende ella jamás lo supo ni le dio cata dello llamábase aldonza lorenzo y a ésta le pareció ser bien darle título de señora de sus pensamientos y buscándole nombre que no desdijese mucho del suyo y que tirase y se encaminase al de princesa y gran señora vino a llamarla dulcinea del toboso porque era natural del toboso nombre a su parecer músico y peregrino y significativo como todos los demás que a él y a sus cosas había puesto  capítulo ii que trata de la primera salida que de su tierra hizo el ingenioso don quijote hechas pues estas prevenciones no quiso aguardar más tiempo a poner en efeto su pensamiento apretándole a ello la falta que él pensaba que hacía en el mundo su tardanza según eran los agravios que pensaba deshacer tuertos que enderezar sinrazones que emendar y abusos que mejorar y deudas que satisfacer y así sin dar parte a persona alguna de su intención y sin que nadie le viese una mañana antes del día que era uno de los calurosos del mes de julio se armó de todas sus armas subió sobre rocinante puesta su mal compuesta celada embrazó su adarga tomó su lanza y por la puerta falsa de un corral salió al campo con grandísimo contento y alborozo de ver con cuánta facilidad había dado principio a su buen deseo mas apenas se vio en el campo cuando le asaltó un pensamiento terrible y tal que por poco le hiciera dejar la comenzada empresa y fue que le vino a la memoria que no era armado caballero y que conforme a ley de caballería ni podía ni debía tomar armas con ningún caballero y puesto que lo fuera había de llevar armas blancas como novel caballero sin empresa en el escudo hasta que por su esfuerzo la ganase estos pensamientos le hicieron titubear en su propósito mas pudiendo más su locura que otra razón alguna propuso de hacerse armar caballero del primero que topase a imitación de otros muchos que así lo hicieron según él había leído en los libros que tal le tenían en lo de las armas blancas pensaba limpiarlas de manera en teniendo lugar que lo fuesen más que un armiño y con esto se quietó y prosiguió su camino sin llevar otro que aquel que su caballo quería creyendo que en aquello consistía la fuerza de las aventuras yendo pues caminando nuestro flamante aventurero iba hablando consigo mesmo y diciendo quién duda sino que en los venideros tiempos cuando salga a luz la verdadera historia de mis famosos hechos que el sabio que los escribiere no ponga cuando llegue a contar esta mi primera salidad tan de mañana desta manera apenas había el rubicundo apolo tendido por la faz de la ancha y espaciosa tierra las doradas hebras de sus hermosos cabellos y apenas los pequeños y pintados pajarillos con sus arpadas lenguas habían saludado con dulce y meliflua armonía la venida de la rosada aurora que dejando la blanda cama del celoso marido por las puertas y balcones del manchego horizonte a los mortales se mostraba cuando el famoso caballero don quijote de la mancha dejando las ociosas plumas subió sobre su famoso caballo rocinante y comenzó a caminar por el antiguo y conocido campo de montiel y era la verdad que por él caminaba y añadió diciendo dichosa edad y siglo dichoso aquel adonde saldrán a luz las famosas hazañas mías dignas de entallarse en bronces esculpirse en mármoles y pintarse en tablas para memoria en lo futuro oh tú sabio encantador quienquiera que seas a quien ha de tocar el ser coronista desta peregrina historia ruégote que no te olvides de mi buen rocinante compañero eterno mío en todos mis caminos y carreras luego volvía diciendo como si verdaderamente fuera enamorado oh princesa dulcinea señora deste cautivo corazón mucho agravio me habedes fecho en despedirme y reprocharme con el riguroso afincamiento de mandarme no parecer ante la vuestra fermosura plégaos señora de membraros deste vuestro sujeto corazón que tantas cuitas por vuestro amor padece con éstos iba ensartando otros disparates todos al modo de los que sus libros le habían enseñado imitando en cuanto podía su lenguaje con esto caminaba tan despacio y el sol entraba tan apriesa y con tanto ardor que fuera bastante a derretirle los sesos si algunos tuviera casi todo aquel día caminó sin acontecerle cosa que de contar fuese de lo cual se desesperaba porque quisiera topar luego luego con quien hacer experiencia del valor de su fuerte brazo autores hay que dicen que la primera aventura que le avino fue la del puerto lápice otros dicen que la de los molinos de viento pero lo que yo he podido averiguar en este caso y lo que he hallado escrito en los anales de la mancha es que él anduvo todo aquel día y al anochecer su rocín y él se hallaron cansados y muertos de hambre y que mirando a todas partes por ver si descubriría algún castillo o alguna majada de pastores donde recogerse y adonde pudiese remediar su mucha hambre y necesidad vio no lejos del camino por donde iba una venta que fue como si viera una estrella que no a los portales sino a los alcázares de su redención le encaminaba diose priesa a caminar y llegó a ella a tiempo que anochecía estaban acaso a la puerta dos mujeres mozas destas que llaman del partido las cuales iban a sevilla con unos arrieros que en la venta aquella noche acertaron a hacer jornada y como a nuestro aventurero todo cuanto pensaba veía o imaginaba le parecía ser hecho y pasar al modo de lo que había leído luego que vio la venta se le representó que era un castillo con sus cuatro torres y chapiteles de luciente plata sin faltarle su puente levadiza y honda cava con todos aquellos adherentes que semejantes castillos se pintan fuese llegando a la venta que a él le parecía castillo y a poco trecho della detuvo las riendas a rocinante esperando que algún enano se pusiese entre las almenas a dar señal con alguna trompeta de que llegaba caballero al castillo pero como vio que se tardaban y que rocinante se daba priesa por llegar a la caballeriza se llegó a la puerta de la venta y vio a las dos destraídas mozas que allí estaban que a él le parecieron dos hermosas doncellas o dos graciosas damas que delante de la puerta del castillo se estaban solazando en esto sucedió acaso que un porquero que andaba recogiendo de unos rastrojos una manada de puercos que sin perdón así se llaman tocó un cuerno a cuya señal ellos se recogen y al instante se le representó a don quijote lo que deseaba que era que algún enano hacía señal de su venida y así con estraño contento llegó a la venta y a las damas las cuales como vieron venir un hombre de aquella suerte armado y con lanza y adarga llenas de miedo se iban a entrar en la venta pero don quijote coligiendo por su huida su miedo alzándose la visera de papelón y descubriendo su seco y polvoroso rostro con gentil talante y voz reposada les dijo no fuyan las vuestras mercedes ni teman desaguisado alguno ca a la orden de caballería que profeso non toca ni atañe facerle a ninguno cuanto más a tan altas doncellas como vuestras presencias demuestran mirábanle las mozas y andaban con los ojos buscándole el rostro que la mala visera le encubría mas como se oyeron llamar doncellas cosa tan fuera de su profesión no pudieron tener la risa y fue de manera que don quijote vino a correrse y a decirles bien parece la mesura en las fermosas y es mucha sandez además la risa que de leve causa procede pero no vos lo digo porque os acuitedes ni mostredes mal talante que el mío non es de ál que de serviros el lenguaje no entendido de las señoras y el mal talle de nuestro caballero acrecentaba en ellas la risa y en él el enojo y pasara muy adelante si a aquel punto no saliera el ventero hombre que por ser muy gordo era muy pacífico el cual viendo aquella figura contrahecha armada de armas tan desiguales como eran la brida lanza adarga y coselete no estuvo en nada en acompañar a las doncellas en las muestras de su contento mas en efeto temiendo la máquina de tantos pertrechos determinó de hablarle comedidamente y así le dijo si vuestra merced señor caballero busca posada amén del lecho porque en esta venta no hay ninguno todo lo demás se hallará en ella en mucha abundancia viendo don quijote la humildad del alcaide de la fortaleza que tal le pareció a él el ventero y la venta respondió para mí señor castellano cualquiera cosa basta porque mis arreos son las armas mi descanso el pelear etc pensó el huésped que el haberle llamado castellano había sido por haberle parecido de los sanos de castilla aunque él era andaluz y de los de la playa de sanlúcar no menos ladrón que caco ni menos maleante que estudiantado paje y así le respondió según eso las camas de vuestra merced serán duras peñas y su dormir siempre velar y siendo así bien se puede apear con seguridad de hallar en esta choza ocasión y ocasiones para no dormir en todo un año cuanto más en una noche y diciendo esto fue a tener el estribo a don quijote el cual se apeó con mucha dificultad y trabajo como aquel que en todo aquel día no se había desayunado dijo luego al huésped que le tuviese mucho cuidado de su caballo porque era la mejor pieza que comía pan en el mundo miróle el ventero y no le pareció tan bueno como don quijote decía ni aun la mitad y acomodándole en la caballeriza volvió a ver lo que su huésped mandaba al cual estaban desarmando las doncellas que ya se habían reconciliado con él las cuales aunque le habían quitado el peto y el espaldar jamás supieron ni pudieron desencajarle la gola ni quitalle la contrahecha celada que traía atada con unas cintas verdes y era menester cortarlas por no poderse quitar los ñudos mas él no lo quiso consentir en ninguna manera y así se quedó toda aquella noche con la celada puesta que era la más graciosa y estraña figura que se pudiera pensar y al desarmarle como él se imaginaba que aquellas traídas y llevadas que le desarmaban eran algunas principales señoras y damas de aquel castillo les dijo con mucho donaire nunca fuera caballero de damas tan bien servido como fuera don quijote cuando de su aldea vino doncellas curaban dél princesas del su rocino o rocinante que éste es el nombre señoras mías de mi caballo y don quijote de la mancha el mío que puesto que no quisiera descubrirme fasta que las fazañas fechas en vuestro servicio y pro me descubrieran la fuerza de acomodar al propósito presente este romance viejo de lanzarote ha sido causa que sepáis mi nombre antes de toda sazón pero tiempo vendrá en que las vuestras señorías me manden y yo obedezca y el valor de mi brazo descubra el deseo que tengo de serviros las mozas que no estaban hechas a oír semejantes retóricas no respondían palabra sólo le preguntaron si quería comer alguna cosa cualquiera yantaría yo respondió don quijote porque a lo que entiendo me haría mucho al caso a dicha acertó a ser viernes aquel día y no había en toda la venta sino unas raciones de un pescado que en castilla llaman abadejo y en andalucía bacallao y en otras partes curadillo y en otras truchuela preguntáronle si por ventura comería su merced truchuela que no había otro pescado que dalle a comer como haya muchas truchuelas respondió don quijote podrán servir de una trucha porque eso se me da que me den ocho reales en sencillos que en una pieza de a ocho cuanto más que podría ser que fuesen estas truchuelas como la ternera que es mejor que la vaca y el cabrito que el cabrón pero sea lo que fuere venga luego que el trabajo y peso de las armas no se puede llevar sin el gobierno de las tripas pusiéronle la mesa a la puerta de la venta por el fresco y trújole el huésped una porción del mal remojado y peor cocido bacallao y un pan tan negro y mugriento como sus armas pero era materia de grande risa verle comer porque como tenía puesta la celada y alzada la visera no podía poner nada en la boca con sus manos si otro no se lo daba y ponía y ansí una de aquellas señoras servía deste menester mas al darle de beber no fue posible ni lo fuera si el ventero no horadara una caña y puesto el un cabo en la boca por el otro le iba echando el vino y todo esto lo recebía en paciencia a trueco de no romper las cintas de la celada estando en esto llegó acaso a la venta un castrador de puercos y así como llegó sonó su silbato de cañas cuatro o cinco veces con lo cual acabó de confirmar don quijote que estaba en algún famoso castillo y que le servían con música y que el abadejo eran truchas el pan candeal y las rameras damas y el ventero castellano del castillo y con esto daba por bien empleada su determinación y salida mas lo que más le fatigaba era el no verse armado caballero por parecerle que no se podría poner legítimamente en aventura alguna sin recebir la orden de caballería  capítulo iii donde se cuenta la graciosa manera que tuvo don quijote en armarse caballero y así fatigado deste pensamiento abrevió su venteril y limitada cena la cual acabada llamó al ventero y encerrándose con él en la caballeriza se hincó de rodillas ante él diciéndole no me levantaré jamás de donde estoy valeroso caballero fasta que la vuestra cortesía me otorgue un don que pedirle quiero el cual redundará en alabanza vuestra y en pro del género humano el ventero que vio a su huésped a sus pies y oyó semejantes razones estaba confuso mirándole sin saber qué hacerse ni decirle y porfiaba con él que se levantase y jamás quiso hasta que le hubo de decir que él le otorgaba el don que le pedía no esperaba yo menos de la gran magnificencia vuestra señor mío respondió don quijote y así os digo que el don que os he pedido y de vuestra liberalidad me ha sido otorgado es que mañana en aquel día me habéis de armar caballero y esta noche en la capilla deste vuestro castillo velaré las armas y mañana como tengo dicho se cumplirá lo que tanto deseo para poder como se debe ir por todas las cuatro partes del mundo buscando las aventuras en pro de los menesterosos como está a cargo de la caballería y de los caballeros andantes como yo soy cuyo deseo a semejantes fazañas es inclinado el ventero que como está dicho era un poco socarrón y ya tenía algunos barruntos de la falta de juicio de su huésped acabó de creerlo cuando acabó de oírle semejantes razones y por tener qué reír aquella noche determinó de seguirle el humor y así le dijo que andaba muy acertado en lo que deseaba y pedía y que tal prosupuesto era propio y natural de los caballeros tan principales como él parecía y como su gallarda presencia mostraba y que él ansimesmo en los años de su mocedad se había dado a aquel honroso ejercicio andando por diversas partes del mundo buscando sus aventuras sin que hubiese dejado los percheles de málaga islas de riarán compás de sevilla azoguejo de segovia la olivera de valencia rondilla de granada playa de sanlúcar potro de córdoba y las ventillas de toledo y otras diversas partes donde había ejercitado la ligereza de sus pies sutileza de sus manos haciendo muchos tuertos recuestando muchas viudas deshaciendo algunas doncellas y engañando a algunos pupilos y finalmente dándose a conocer por cuantas audiencias y tribunales hay casi en toda españa y que a lo último se había venido a recoger a aquel su castillo donde vivía con su hacienda y con las ajenas recogiendo en él a todos los caballeros andantes de cualquiera calidad y condición que fuesen sólo por la mucha afición que les tenía y porque partiesen con él de sus haberes en pago de su buen deseo díjole también que en aquel su castillo no había capilla alguna donde poder velar las armas porque estaba derribada para hacerla de nuevo pero que en caso de necesidad él sabía que se podían velar dondequiera y que aquella noche las podría velar en un patio del castillo que a la mañana siendo dios servido se harían las debidas ceremonias de manera que él quedase armado caballero y tan caballero que no pudiese ser más en el mundo preguntóle si traía dineros respondió don quijote que no traía blanca porque él nunca había leído en las historias de los caballeros andantes que ninguno los hubiese traído a esto dijo el ventero que se engañaba que puesto caso que en las historias no se escribía por haberles parecido a los autores dellas que no era menester escrebir una cosa tan clara y tan necesaria de traerse como eran dineros y camisas limpias no por eso se había de creer que no los trujeron y así tuviese por cierto y averiguado que todos los caballeros andantes de que tantos libros están llenos y atestados llevaban bien herradas las bolsas por lo que pudiese sucederles y que asimismo llevaban camisas y una arqueta pequeña llena de ungüentos para curar las heridas que recebían porque no todas veces en los campos y desiertos donde se combatían y salían heridos había quien los curase si ya no era que tenían algún sabio encantador por amigo que luego los socorría trayendo por el aire en alguna nube alguna doncella o enano con alguna redoma de agua de tal virtud que en gustando alguna gota della luego al punto quedaban sanos de sus llagas y heridas como si mal alguno hubiesen tenido mas que en tanto que esto no hubiese tuvieron los pasados caballeros por cosa acertada que sus escuderos fuesen proveídos de dineros y de otras cosas necesarias como eran hilas y ungüentos para curarse y cuando sucedía que los tales caballeros no tenían escuderos que eran pocas y raras veces ellos mesmos lo llevaban todo en unas alforjas muy sutiles que casi no se parecían a las ancas del caballo como que era otra cosa de más importancia porque no siendo por ocasión semejante esto de llevar alforjas no fue muy admitido entre los caballeros andantes y por esto le daba por consejo pues aún se lo podía mandar como a su ahijado que tan presto lo había de ser que no caminase de allí adelante sin dineros y sin las prevenciones referidas y que vería cuán bien se hallaba con ellas cuando menos se pensase prometióle don quijote de hacer lo que se le aconsejaba con toda puntualidad y así se dio luego orden como velase las armas en un corral grande que a un lado de la venta estaba y recogiéndolas don quijote todas las puso sobre una pila que junto a un pozo estaba y embrazando su adarga asió de su lanza y con gentil continente se comenzó a pasear delante de la pila y cuando comenzó el paseo comenzaba a cerrar la noche contó el ventero a todos cuantos estaban en la venta la locura de su huésped la vela de las armas y la armazón de caballería que esperaba admiráronse de tan estraño género de locura y fuéronselo a mirar desde lejos y vieron que con sosegado ademán unas veces se paseaba otras arrimado a su lanza ponía los ojos en las armas sin quitarlos por un buen espacio dellas acabó de cerrar la noche pero con tanta claridad de la luna que podía competir con el que se la prestaba de manera que cuanto el novel caballero hacía era bien visto de todos antojósele en esto a uno de los arrieros que estaban en la venta ir a dar agua a su recua y fue menester quitar las armas de don quijote que estaban sobre la pila el cual viéndole llegar en voz alta le dijo oh tú quienquiera que seas atrevido caballero que llegas a tocar las armas del más valeroso andante que jamás se ciñó espada mira lo que haces y no las toques si no quieres dejar la vida en pago de tu atrevimiento no se curó el arriero destas razones y fuera mejor que se curara porque fuera curarse en salud antes trabando de las correas las arrojó gran trecho de sí lo cual visto por don quijote alzó los ojos al cielo y puesto el pensamiento a lo que pareció en su señora dulcinea dijo acorredme señora mía en esta primera afrenta que a este vuestro avasallado pecho se le ofrece no me desfallezca en este primero trance vuestro favor y amparo y diciendo estas y otras semejantes razones soltando la adarga alzó la lanza a dos manos y dio con ella tan gran golpe al arriero en la cabeza que le derribó en el suelo tan maltrecho que si segundara con otro no tuviera necesidad de maestro que le curara hecho esto recogió sus armas y tornó a pasearse con el mismo reposo que primero desde allí a poco sin saberse lo que había pasado porque aún estaba aturdido el arriero llegó otro con la mesma intención de dar agua a sus mulos y llegando a quitar las armas para desembarazar la pila sin hablar don quijote palabra y sin pedir favor a nadie soltó otra vez la adarga y alzó otra vez la lanza y sin hacerla pedazos hizo más de tres la cabeza del segundo arriero porque se la abrió por cuatro al ruido acudió toda la gente de la venta y entre ellos el ventero viendo esto don quijote embrazó su adarga y puesta mano a su espada dijo oh señora de la fermosura esfuerzo y vigor del debilitado corazón mío ahora es tiempo que vuelvas los ojos de tu grandeza a este tu cautivo caballero que tamaña aventura está atendiendo con esto cobró a su parecer tanto ánimo que si le acometieran todos los arrieros del mundo no volviera el pie atrás los compañeros de los heridos que tales los vieron comenzaron desde lejos a llover piedras sobre don quijote el cual lo mejor que podía se reparaba con su adarga y no se osaba apartar de la pila por no desamparar las armas el ventero daba voces que le dejasen porque ya les había dicho como era loco y que por loco se libraría aunque los matase a todos también don quijote las daba mayores llamándolos de alevosos y traidores y que el señor del castillo era un follón y mal nacido caballero pues de tal manera consentía que se tratasen los andantes caballeros y que si él hubiera recebido la orden de caballería que él le diera a entender su alevosía pero de vosotros soez y baja canalla no hago caso alguno tirad llegad venid y ofendedme en cuanto pudiéredes que vosotros veréis el pago que lleváis de vuestra sandez y demasía decía esto con tanto brío y denuedo que infundió un terrible temor en los que le acometían y así por esto como por las persuasiones del ventero le dejaron de tirar y él dejó retirar a los heridos y tornó a la vela de sus armas con la misma quietud y sosiego que primero no le parecieron bien al ventero las burlas de su huésped y determinó abreviar y darle la negra orden de caballería luego antes que otra desgracia sucediese y así llegándose a él se desculpó de la insolencia que aquella gente baja con él había usado sin que él supiese cosa alguna pero que bien castigados quedaban de su atrevimiento díjole como ya le había dicho que en aquel castillo no había capilla y para lo que restaba de hacer tampoco era necesaria que todo el toque de quedar armado caballero consistía en la pescozada y en el espaldarazo según él tenía noticia del ceremonial de la orden y que aquello en mitad de un campo se podía hacer y que ya había cumplido con lo que tocaba al velar de las armas que con solas dos horas de vela se cumplía cuanto más que él había estado más de cuatro todo se lo creyó don quijote y dijo que él estaba allí pronto para obedecerle y que concluyese con la mayor brevedad que pudiese porque si fuese otra vez acometido y se viese armado caballero no pensaba dejar persona viva en el castillo eceto aquellas que él le mandase a quien por su respeto dejaría advertido y medroso desto el castellano trujo luego un libro donde asentaba la paja y cebada que daba a los arrieros y con un cabo de vela que le traía un muchacho y con las dos ya dichas doncellas se vino adonde don quijote estaba al cual mandó hincar de rodillas y leyendo en su manual como que decía alguna devota oración en mitad de la leyenda alzó la mano y diole sobre el cuello un buen golpe y tras él con su mesma espada un gentil espaldazaro siempre murmurando entre dientes como que rezaba hecho esto mandó a una de aquellas damas que le ciñese la espada la cual lo hizo con mucha desenvoltura y discreción porque no fue menester poca para no reventar de risa a cada punto de las ceremonias pero las proezas que ya habían visto del novel caballero les tenía la risa a raya al ceñirle la espada dijo la buena señora dios haga a vuestra merced muy venturoso caballero y le dé ventura en lides don quijote le preguntó cómo se llamaba porque él supiese de allí adelante a quién quedaba obligado por la merced recebida porque pensaba darle alguna parte de la honra que alcanzase por el valor de su brazo ella respondió con mucha humildad que se llamaba la tolosa y que era hija de un remendón natural de toledo que vivía a las tendillas de sancho bienaya y que dondequiera que ella estuviese le serviría y le tendría por señor don quijote le replicó que por su amor le hiciese merced que de allí adelante se pusiese don y se llamase doña tolosa ella se lo prometió y la otra le calzó la espuela con la cual le pasó casi el mismo coloquio que con la de la espada preguntóle su nombre y dijo que se llamaba la molinera y que era hija de un honrado molinero de antequera a la cual también rogó don quijote que se pusiese don y se llamase doña molinera ofreciéndole nuevos servicios y mercedes hechas pues de galope y aprisa las hasta allí nunca vistas ceremonias no vio la hora don quijote de verse a caballo y salir buscando las aventuras y ensillando luego a rocinante subió en él y abrazando a su huésped le dijo cosas tan estrañas agradeciéndole la merced de haberle armado caballero que no es posible acertar a referirlas el ventero por verle ya fuera de la venta con no menos retóricas aunque con más breves palabras respondió a las suyas y sin pedirle la costa de la posada le dejó ir a la buen hora  capítulo iv de lo que le sucedió a nuestro caballero cuando salió de la venta la del alba sería cuando don quijote salió de la venta tan contento tan gallardo tan alborozado por verse ya armado caballero que el gozo le reventaba por las cinchas del caballo mas viniéndole a la memoria los consejos de su huésped cerca de las prevenciones tan necesarias que había de llevar consigo especial la de los dineros y camisas determinó volver a su casa y acomodarse de todo y de un escudero haciendo cuenta de recebir a un labrador vecino suyo que era pobre y con hijos pero muy a propósito para el oficio escuderil de la caballería con este pensamiento guió a rocinante hacia su aldea el cual casi conociendo la querencia con tanta gana comenzó a caminar que parecía que no ponía los pies en el suelo no había andado mucho cuando le pareció que a su diestra mano de la espesura de un bosque que allí estaba salían unas voces delicadas como de persona que se quejaba y apenas las hubo oído cuando dijo gracias doy al cielo por la merced que me hace pues tan presto me pone ocasiones delante donde yo pueda cumplir con lo que debo a mi profesión y donde pueda coger el fruto de mis buenos deseos estas voces sin duda son de algún menesteroso o menesterosa que ha menester mi favor y ayuda y volviendo las riendas encaminó a rocinante hacia donde le pareció que las voces salían y a pocos pasos que entró por el bosque vio atada una yegua a una encina y atado en otra a un muchacho desnudo de medio cuerpo arriba hasta de edad de quince años que era el que las voces daba y no sin causa porque le estaba dando con una pretina muchos azotes un labrador de buen talle y cada azote le acompañaba con una reprehensión y consejo porque decía la lengua queda y los ojos listos y el muchacho respondía no lo haré otra vez señor mío por la pasión de dios que no lo haré otra vez y yo prometo de tener de aquí adelante más cuidado con el hato y viendo don quijote lo que pasaba con voz airada dijo descortés caballero mal parece tomaros con quien defender no se puede subid sobre vuestro caballo y tomad vuestra lanza que también tenía una lanza arrimada a la encima adonde estaba arrendada la yegua que yo os haré conocer ser de cobardes lo que estáis haciendo el labrador que vio sobre sí aquella figura llena de armas blandiendo la lanza sobre su rostro túvose por muerto y con buenas palabras respondió señor caballero este muchacho que estoy castigando es un mi criado que me sirve de guardar una manada de ovejas que tengo en estos contornos el cual es tan descuidado que cada día me falta una y porque castigo su descuido o bellaquería dice que lo hago de miserable por no pagalle la soldada que le debo y en dios y en mi ánima que miente miente delante de mí ruin villano dijo don quijote por el sol que nos alumbra que estoy por pasaros de parte a parte con esta lanza pagadle luego sin más réplica si no por el dios que nos rige que os concluya y aniquile en este punto desatadlo luego el labrador bajó la cabeza y sin responder palabra desató a su criado al cual preguntó don quijote que cuánto le debía su amo él dijo que nueve meses a siete reales cada mes hizo la cuenta don quijote y halló que montaban setenta y tres reales y díjole al labrador que al momento los desembolsase si no quería morir por ello respondió el medroso villano que para el paso en que estaba y juramento que había hecho y aún no había jurado nada que no eran tantos porque se le habían de descontar y recebir en cuenta tres pares de zapatos que le había dado y un real de dos sangrías que le habían hecho estando enfermo bien está todo eso replicó don quijote pero quédense los zapatos y las sangrías por los azotes que sin culpa le habéis dado que si él rompió el cuero de los zapatos que vos pagastes vos le habéis rompido el de su cuerpo y si le sacó el barbero sangre estando enfermo vos en sanidad se la habéis sacado ansí que por esta parte no os debe nada el daño está señor caballero en que no tengo aquí dineros véngase andrés conmigo a mi casa que yo se los pagaré un real sobre otro irme yo con él dijo el muchacho mas mal año no señor ni por pienso porque en viéndose solo me desuelle como a un san bartolomé no hará tal replicó don quijote basta que yo se lo mande para que me tenga respeto y con que él me lo jure por la ley de caballería que ha recebido le dejaré ir libre y aseguraré la paga mire vuestra merced señor lo que dice dijo el muchacho que este mi amo no es caballero ni ha recebido orden de caballería alguna que es juan haldudo el rico el vecino del quintanar importa eso poco respondió don quijote que haldudos puede haber caballeros cuanto más que cada uno es hijo de sus obras así es verdad dijo andrés pero este mi amo de qué obras es hijo pues me niega mi soldada y mi sudor y trabajo no niego hermano andrés respondió el labrador y hacedme placer de veniros conmigo que yo juro por todas las órdenes que de caballerías hay en el mundo de pagaros como tengo dicho un real sobre otro y aun sahumados del sahumerio os hago gracia dijo don quijote dádselos en reales que con eso me contento y mirad que lo cumpláis como lo habéis jurado si no por el mismo juramento os juro de volver a buscaros y a castigaros y que os tengo de hallar aunque os escondáis más que una lagartija y si queréis saber quién os manda esto para quedar con más veras obligado a cumplirlo sabed que yo soy el valeroso don quijote de la mancha el desfacedor de agravios y sinrazones y a dios quedad y no se os parta de las mientes lo prometido y jurado so pena de la pena pronunciada y en diciendo esto picó a su rocinante y en breve espacio se apartó dellos siguióle el labrador con los ojos y cuando vio que había traspuesto del bosque y que ya no parecía volvióse a su criado andrés y díjole venid acá hijo mío que os quiero pagar lo que os debo como aquel deshacedor de agravios me dejó mandado eso juro yo dijo andrés y cómo que andará vuestra merced acertado en cumplir el mandamiento de aquel buen caballero que mil años viva que según es de valeroso y de buen juez vive roque que si no me paga que vuelva y ejecute lo que dijo también lo juro yo dijo el labrador pero por lo mucho que os quiero quiero acrecentar la deuda por acrecentar la paga y asiéndole del brazo le tornó a atar a la encina donde le dio tantos azotes que le dejó por muerto llamad señor andrés ahora decía el labrador al desfacedor de agravios veréis cómo no desface aquéste aunque creo que no está acabado de hacer porque me viene gana de desollaros vivo como vos temíades pero al fin le desató y le dio licencia que fuese a buscar su juez para que ejecutase la pronunciada sentencia andrés se partió algo mohíno jurando de ir a buscar al valeroso don quijote de la mancha y contalle punto por punto lo que había pasado y que se lo había de pagar con las setenas pero con todo esto él se partió llorando y su amo se quedó riendo y desta manera deshizo el agravio el valeroso don quijote el cual contentísimo de lo sucedido pareciéndole que había dado felicísimo y alto principio a sus caballerías con gran satisfación de sí mismo iba caminando hacia su aldea diciendo a media voz bien te puedes llamar dichosa sobre cuantas hoy viven en la tierra oh sobre las bellas bella dulcinea del toboso pues te cupo en suerte tener sujeto y rendido a toda tu voluntad e talante a un tan valiente y tan nombrado caballero como lo es y será don quijote de la mancha el cual como todo el mundo sabe ayer rescibió la orden de caballería y hoy ha desfecho el mayor tuerto y agravio que formó la sinrazón y cometió la crueldad hoy quitó el látigo de la mano a aquel despiadado enemigo que tan sin ocasión vapulaba a aquel delicado infante en esto llegó a un camino que en cuatro se dividía y luego se le vino a la imaginación las encrucejadas donde los caballeros andantes se ponían a pensar cuál camino de aquéllos tomarían y por imitarlos estuvo un rato quedo y al cabo de haberlo muy bien pensado soltó la rienda a rocinante dejando a la voluntad del rocín la suya el cual siguió su primer intento que fue el irse camino de su caballeriza y habiendo andado como dos millas descubrió don quijote un grande tropel de gente que como después se supo eran unos mercaderes toledanos que iban a comprar seda a murcia eran seis y venían con sus quitasoles con otros cuatro criados a caballo y tres mozos de mulas a pie apenas los divisó don quijote cuando se imaginó ser cosa de nueva aventura y por imitar en todo cuanto a él le parecía posible los pasos que había leído en sus libros le pareció venir allí de molde uno que pensaba hacer y así con gentil continente y denuedo se afirmó bien en los estribos apretó la lanza llegó la adarga al pecho y puesto en la mitad del camino estuvo esperando que aquellos caballeros andantes llegasen que ya él por tales los tenía y juzgaba y cuando llegaron a trecho que se pudieron ver y oír levantó don quijote la voz y con ademán arrogante dijo todo el mundo se tenga si todo el mundo no confiesa que no hay en el mundo todo doncella más hermosa que la emperatriz de la mancha la sin par dulcinea del toboso paráronse los mercaderes al son destas razones y a ver la estraña figura del que las decía y por la figura y por las razones luego echaron de ver la locura de su dueño mas quisieron ver despacio en qué paraba aquella confesión que se les pedía y uno dellos que era un poco burlón y muy mucho discreto le dijo señor caballero nosotros no conocemos quién sea esa buena señora que decís mostrádnosla que si ella fuere de tanta hermosura como significáis de buena gana y sin apremio alguno confesaremos la verdad que por parte vuestra nos es pedida si os la mostrara replicó don quijote qué hiciérades vosotros en confesar una verdad tan notoria la importancia está en que sin verla lo habéis de creer confesar afirmar jurar y defender donde no conmigo sois en batalla gente descomunal y soberbia que ahora vengáis uno a uno como pide la orden de caballería ora todos juntos como es costumbre y mala usanza de los de vuestra ralea aquí os aguardo y espero confiado en la razón que de mi parte tengo señor caballero replicó el mercader suplico a vuestra merced en nombre de todos estos príncipes que aquí estamos que porque no encarguemos nuestras conciencias confesando una cosa por nosotros jamás vista ni oída y más siendo tan en perjuicio de las emperatrices y reinas del alcarria y estremadura que vuestra merced sea servido de mostrarnos algún retrato de esa señora aunque sea tamaño como un grano de trigo que por el hilo se sacará el ovillo y quedaremos con esto satisfechos y seguros y vuestra merced quedará contento y pagado y aun creo que estamos ya tan de su parte que aunque su retrato nos muestre que es tuerta de un ojo y que del otro le mana bermellón y piedra azufre con todo eso por complacer a vuestra merced diremos en su favor todo lo que quisiere no le mana canalla infame respondió don quijote encendido en cólera no le mana digo eso que decís sino ámbar y algalia entre algodones y no es tuerta ni corcovada sino más derecha que un huso de guadarrama pero vosotros pagaréis la grande blasfemia que habéis dicho contra tamaña beldad como es la de mi señora y en diciendo esto arremetió con la lanza baja contra el que lo había dicho con tanta furia y enojo que si la buena suerte no hiciera que en la mitad del camino tropezara y cayera rocinante lo pasara mal el atrevido mercader cayó rocinante y fue rodando su amo una buena pieza por el campo y queriéndose levantar jamás pudo tal embarazo le causaban la lanza adarga espuelas y celada con el peso de las antiguas armas y entretanto que pugnaba por levantarse y no podía estaba diciendo non fuyáis gente cobarde gente cautiva atended que no por culpa mía sino de mi caballo estoy aquí tendido un mozo de mulas de los que allí venían que no debía de ser muy bien intencionado oyendo decir al pobre caído tantas arrogancias no lo pudo sufrir sin darle la respuesta en las costillas y llegándose a él tomó la lanza y después de haberla hecho pedazos con uno dellos comenzó a dar a nuestro don quijote tantos palos que a despecho y pesar de sus armas le molió como cibera dábanle voces sus amos que no le diese tanto y que le dejase pero estaba ya el mozo picado y no quiso dejar el juego hasta envidar todo el resto de su cólera y acudiendo por los demás trozos de la lanza los acabó de deshacer sobre el miserable caído que con toda aquella tempestad de palos que sobre él vía no cerraba la boca amenazando al cielo y a la tierra y a los malandrines que tal le parecían cansóse el mozo y los mercaderes siguieron su camino llevando qué contar en todo él del pobre apaleado el cual después que se vio solo tornó a probar si podía levantarse pero si no lo pudo hacer cuando sano y bueno cómo lo haría molido y casi deshecho y aún se tenía por dichoso pareciéndole que aquélla era propia desgracia de caballeros andantes y toda la atribuía a la falta de su caballo y no era posible levantarse según tenía brumado todo el cuerpo  capítulo v donde se prosigue la narración de la desgracia de nuestro caballero viendo pues que en efeto no podía menearse acordó de acogerse a su ordinario remedio que era pensar en algún paso de sus libros y trújole su locura a la memoria aquel de valdovinos y del marqués de mantua cuando carloto le dejó herido en la montiña historia sabida de los niños no ignorada de los mozos celebrada y aun creída de los viejos y con todo esto no más verdadera que los milagros de mahoma ésta pues le pareció a él que le venía de molde para el paso en que se hallaba y así con muestras de grande sentimiento se comenzó a volcar por la tierra y a decir con debilitado aliento lo mesmo que dicen decía el herido caballero del bosque donde estás señora mía que no te duele mi mal o no lo sabes señora o eres falsa y desleal y desta manera fue prosiguiendo el romance hasta aquellos versos que dicen oh noble marqués de mantua mi tío y señor carnal y quiso la suerte que cuando llegó a este verso acertó a pasar por allí un labrador de su mesmo lugar y vecino suyo que venía de llevar una carga de trigo al molino el cual viendo aquel hombre allí tendido se llegó a él y le preguntó que quién era y qué mal sentía que tan tristemente se quejaba don quijote creyó sin duda que aquél era el marqués de mantua su tío y así no le respondió otra cosa si no fue proseguir en su romance donde le daba cuenta de su desgracia y de los amores del hijo del emperante con su esposa todo de la mesma manera que el romance lo canta el labrador estaba admirado oyendo aquellos disparates y quitándole la visera que ya estaba hecha pedazos de los palos le limpió el rostro que le tenía cubierto de polvo y apenas le hubo limpiado cuando le conoció y le dijo señor quijana que así se debía de llamar cuando él tenía juicio y no había pasado de hidalgo sosegado a caballero andante quién ha puesto a vuestra merced desta suerte pero él seguía con su romance a cuanto le preguntaba viendo esto el buen hombre lo mejor que pudo le quitó el peto y espaldar para ver si tenía alguna herida pero no vio sangre ni señal alguna procuró levantarle del suelo y no con poco trabajo le subió sobre su jumento por parecer caballería más sosegada recogió las armas hasta las astillas de la lanza y liólas sobre rocinante al cual tomó de la rienda y del cabestro al asno y se encaminó hacia su pueblo bien pensativo de oír los disparates que don quijote decía y no menos iba don quijote que de puro molido y quebrantado no se podía tener sobre el borrico y de cuando en cuando daba unos suspiros que los ponía en el cielo de modo que de nuevo obligó a que el labrador le preguntase le dijese qué mal sentía y no parece sino que el diablo le traía a la memoria los cuentos acomodados a sus sucesos porque en aquel punto olvidándose de valdovinos se acordó del moro abindarráez cuando el alcaide de antequera rodrigo de narváez le prendió y llevó cautivo a su alcaidía de suerte que cuando el labrador le volvió a preguntar que cómo estaba y qué sentía le respondió las mesmas palabras y razones que el cautivo abencerraje respondía a rodrigo de narváez del mesmo modo que él había leído la historia en la diana de jorge de montemayor donde se escribe aprovechándose della tan a propósito que el labrador se iba dando al diablo de oír tanta máquina de necedades por donde conoció que su vecino estaba loco y dábale priesa a llegar al pueblo por escusar el enfado que don quijote le causaba con su larga arenga al cabo de lo cual dijo sepa vuestra merced señor don rodrigo de narváez que esta hermosa jarifa que he dicho es ahora la linda dulcinea del toboso por quien yo he hecho hago y haré los más famosos hechos de caballerías que se han visto vean ni verán en el mundo a esto respondió el labrador mire vuestra merced señor pecador de mí que yo no soy don rodrigo de narváez ni el marqués de mantua sino pedro alonso su vecino ni vuestra merced es valdovinos ni abindarráez sino el honrado hidalgo del señor quijana yo sé quién soy respondió don quijote y sé que puedo ser no sólo los que he dicho sino todos los doce pares de francia y aun todos los nueve de la fama pues a todas las hazañas que ellos todos juntos y cada uno por sí hicieron se aventajarán las mías en estas pláticas y en otras semejantes llegaron al lugar a la hora que anochecía pero el labrador aguardó a que fuese algo más noche porque no viesen al molido hidalgo tan mal caballero llegada pues la hora que le pareció entró en el pueblo y en la casa de don quijote la cual halló toda alborotada y estaban en ella el cura y el barbero del lugar que eran grandes amigos de don quijote que estaba diciéndoles su ama a voces qué le parece a vuestra merced señor licenciado pero pérez que así se llamaba el cura de la desgracia de mi señor tres días ha que no parecen él ni el rocín ni la adarga ni la lanza ni las armas desventurada de mí que me doy a entender y así es ello la verdad como nací para morir que estos malditos libros de caballerías que él tiene y suele leer tan de ordinario le han vuelto el juicio que ahora me acuerdo haberle oído decir muchas veces hablando entre sí que quería hacerse caballero andante e irse a buscar las aventuras por esos mundos encomendados sean a satanás y a barrabás tales libros que así han echado a perder el más delicado entendimiento que había en toda la mancha la sobrina decía lo mesmo y aun decía más sepa señor maese nicolás que éste era el nombre del barbero que muchas veces le aconteció a mi señor tío estarse leyendo en estos desalmados libros de desventuras dos días con sus noches al cabo de los cuales arrojaba el libro de las manos y ponía mano a la espada y andaba a cuchilladas con las paredes y cuando estaba muy cansado decía que había muerto a cuatro gigantes como cuatro torres y el sudor que sudaba del cansancio decía que era sangre de las feridas que había recebido en la batalla y bebíase luego un gran jarro de agua fría y quedaba sano y sosegado diciendo que aquella agua era una preciosísima bebida que le había traído el sabio esquife un grande encantador y amigo suyo mas yo me tengo la culpa de todo que no avisé a vuestras mercedes de los disparates de mi señor tío para que lo remediaran antes de llegar a lo que ha llegado y quemaran todos estos descomulgados libros que tiene muchos que bien merecen ser abrasados como si fuesen de herejes esto digo yo también dijo el cura y a fee que no se pase el día de mañana sin que dellos no se haga acto público y sean condenados al fuego porque no den ocasión a quien los leyere de hacer lo que mi buen amigo debe de haber hecho todo esto estaban oyendo el labrador y don quijote con que acabó de entender el labrador la enfermedad de su vecino y así comenzó a decir a voces abran vuestras mercedes al señor valdovinos y al señor marqués de mantua que viene malferido y al señor moro abindarráez que trae cautivo el valeroso rodrigo de narváez alcaide de antequera a estas voces salieron todos y como conocieron los unos a su amigo las otras a su amo y tío que aún no se había apeado del jumento porque no podía corrieron a abrazarle él dijo ténganse todos que vengo malferido por la culpa de mi caballo llévenme a mi lecho y llámese si fuere posible a la sabia urganda que cure y cate de mis feridas mirá en hora maza dijo a este punto el ama si me decía a mí bien mi corazón del pie que cojeaba mi señor suba vuestra merced en buen hora que sin que venga esa hurgada le sabremos aquí curar malditos digo sean otra vez y otras ciento estos libros de caballerías que tal han parado a vuestra merced lleváronle luego a la cama y catándole las feridas no le hallaron ninguna y él dijo que todo era molimiento por haber dado una gran caída con rocinante su caballo combatiéndose con diez jayanes los más desaforados y atrevidos que se pudieran fallar en gran parte de la tierra ta ta dijo el cura jayanes hay en la danza para mi santiguada que yo los queme mañana antes que llegue la noche hiciéronle a don quijote mil preguntas y a ninguna quiso responder otra cosa sino que le diesen de comer y le dejasen dormir que era lo que más le importaba hízose así y el cura se informó muy a la larga del labrador del modo que había hallado a don quijote él se lo contó todo con los disparates que al hallarle y al traerle había dicho que fue poner más deseo en el licenciado de hacer lo que otro día hizo que fue llamar a su amigo el barbero maese nicolás con el cual se vino a casa de don quijote

presidente manuel ávila camacho la letra del himno alude a victorias mexicanas en batallas y trata sobre la defensa de la patria sus estrofas y estribillo fueron compuestas por el poeta potosino francisco gonzález bocanegra en 1853 mientras que su música obra del músico español jaime nunó fue compuesta al año siguiente en su versión original el himno está compuesto por diez estrofas pero en los noventa años que pasó para su oficialización pasó por varias modificaciones o intentos de modificación quedando reducido solo a cuatro estrofas y el estribillo a partir de 1943 cuando fue oficializado características himno nacional mexicano vocal versión utilizada en radio y televisión problemas al reproducir este archivo las características y uso del himno nacional mexicano está regulada por la ley sobre el escudo la bandera y el himno nacionales en sus artículos 1 4 capítulo v de los artículos 38 a 49 y el capítulo especial de los artículos 57 a 60 y se menciona que el texto del himno y partitura de la música se encuentran autentificados por firma de los titulares de los poderes federales en una copia triple que se deposita para su resguardo en el archivo general de la nación en la biblioteca nacional y en el museo nacional de historia letra la letra oficial del himno mexicano se compone de cuatro estrofas y un estribillo como marca el artículo 57 de la citada ley y

guirnaldas de oliva un recuerdo para ellos de gloria un laurel para ti de victoria un sepulcro para ellos de honor oficialmente en 1943 el texto del himno nacional fue completamente publicado con sus diez estrofas y estribillo pero algunas se recortaron porque hacían referencia a santa anna por eso se recortó a solo cuatro estrofas que son las estrofas i v vi y x de la versión original y el estribillo la modificación de la letra fue ordenada primero por el presidente manuel ávila camacho pero solo se oficializó en 1984 por el presidente miguel de la madrid hurtado a las cuatro estrofas con el fin de hacerlo más fácil de interpretar música en el capítulo especial artículo 58 de la ley se presenta una copia de la partitura de la música del himno consistente básicamente en dos partes

nacional sólo se ejecutará total o parcialmente en actos solemnes de carácter oficial cívico cultural escolar o deportivo  en el caso de las versiones parciales indica que en planteles escolares y eventos deportivos tales como los juegos olímpicos las únicas partes del himno que pueden interpretarse o reproducirse son estribillo y estrofa i otras salvedades son para otros casos como los cierres y aperturas de trasmisiones de estaciones de radio o televisión pueden alterar dentro de las cuatro estrofas oficiales y previa autorización de la secretaría de gobernación la versión que transmiten aunque nunca pueden acortar las versiones completas que se producen durante ceremonias oficiales en ceremonias oficiales en territorio mexicano de instituciones públicas y privadas donde deba tocarse el himno nacional y otro extranjero se ejecutará en primer lugar el mexicano pero si existe un protocolo como en los juegos olímpicos se interpretará de acuerdo al orden que marque el protocolo correspondiente de ese acto por otro lado su uso como distintivo de honor se ejecuta acompañado de otra música por ejemplo para hacer honores al presidente de la república las bandas militares presentes tocarán la marcha de honor el caso de honores a la bandera las bandas de música ejecutarán el himno y a la vez las bandas militares tocarán la marcha llamada bandera y establece un límite a sus interpretaciones en ese caso dos veces para hacer honores a la bandera y rendir honores al presidente de la república aunque se indica la salvedad de que cuando sea interpretado por un coro las bandas militares deberán permanecer en silencio para apagar al coro en cualquier caso los presentes deberán demostrar el respecto asumiendo la posición de firme y en caso de que existan varones deben tener la cabeza descubierta salvedad que se hace con militares que disponen de un ceremonial propio uso en el extranjero en el extranjero las embajadas consulados y legaciones oficiales de la secretaria de relaciones exteriores son las encargadas de la vigilancia de la aplicación de la ley y el respeto al himno nacional evitando su uso comercial y autorizando su interpretación previa

aficionados mexicanos interpretando el himno nacional antes de un partido de fútbol tras la escritura del himno méxico seguía enfrentándose a los efectos de una derrota en una guerra con estados unidos el país se sentía desmoralizado y también dividido debido a la pérdida de aproximadamente la mitad de su territorio el cual le pertenecía ya a estados unidos de acuerdo con el historiador javier garciadiego quien habló en una ceremonia conmemorativa del 150º aniversario de la aprobación del himno en 2004 el himno hace caso omiso a las divisiones y conflictos y anima la unidad nacional en esa misma fecha la ciudad de méxico y otras partes del país detuvieron lo que hacían e interpretaron un canto del himno a nivel nacional individuos de otras naciones participaron también mayoritariamente en las oficinas diplomáticas o en lugares donde se encontraban una alta concentración de expatriados de méxico el himno también ha sido descrito como uno de los símbolos de la identidad mexicana antes de 1820 entre los pueblos prehispánicos no se tiene noticia de que existiera al menos algo parecido a un himno que se identificara unívocamente a algunos de los altépetl pero al llegar las tradiciones europeas tras la llamada conquista española florecieron los llamados himnos religiosos en cuyas letras y música alababan la vida de algún santo o la deidad de la iglesia católica así como los himnos cívicos que trataban de alabar la llegada de virreyes de obispos clérigos la entronización de reyes españoles y más comúnmente la vida de algún personaje o grupo novohispano de entre los autores más destacados de ese tipo de himnos tenemos a manuel de sumaya josé de torres y josé aldana cuya obra religiosa fue profusamente elogiadas en su tiempo y aún hoy destacan de toda su obra los himnos dedicados a la virgen de guadalupe la primera vez que existió en méxico algo muy parecido a un himno nacional fue la llamada marcha real o marcha granadera que desde 1761 se empezó a usar en españa y sus colonias durante las ceremonias cívicas autoría de manuel de espinosa de los monteros fue una obra de cierto agrado que influyo en los años posteriores en el nuevo nacionalismo mexicano que se formó durante la guerra de independencia siglo xix al consumarse la independencia de méxico en 1821 el nuevo nacionalismo mexicano solo impulsó la creación de un escudo y bandera nacional como símbolo del nuevo estado al parecer la idea de un himno nacional no era una necesidad por eso durante la entronización de agustín de iturbide se cantó el himno religioso veni creator en forma especial posteriormente el protocolo de toma del cargo para el primer presidente y vicepresidente de méxico no incluyó ningún himno o canción usada como un himno a pesar de eso durante ese primer medio siglo nunca faltaron propuestas informales de himnos que trataron de tomar el lugar por ejemplo durante la etapa final de la guerra de independencia se realizó un sitio a la ciudad de querétaro por parte de tropas trigarantes entre esas tropas se encontraba un músico llamado josé torrescano quien compuso un himno muy anti español cuya frase más cuestionada era somos independientesviva la libertadviva américa librey viva la igualdad por eso no fue muy promovido el himno ya que la idea del ejército trigarante era lograr la unidad de todos los grupos sociales de la nueva españa ya en lo que se considera el méxico independiente en 1822 otro músico de nombre josé maría garmendía realizó otro himno que no gustó por estar muy centrado en la figura de agustín de iturbide por ejemplo sus primeras palabras eran a las armas valientes indianosa las armas corred con valorel partido seguid de iturbideseamos libres y no haya opresión por eso al cambiar de régimen monárquico a republicano este fue totalmente olvidado luego durante las república tanto federalista como centralista cuando se querían hacer honores al presidente o vicepresidente se interpretaba alguna pieza de su agrado por ejemplo antonio lópez de santa anna gustaba de la obertura semiramis de gioachino rossini mientras josé joaquín de herrera prefería poeta y campesino de franz von suppé el 13 de julio de 1844 otro músico de nombre musicalizó un poema anónimo que honraba a antonio lópez de santa anna quien estaba en su 8º periodo de gobierno durante la república centralista este no gustó al público y terminó olvidado en 1849 luego de la desastrosa guerra mexicanaestadounidense de 1846 a 1848 y durante la presidencia federal de josé joaquín de herrera se formó una llamada junta patriótica de la ciudad de méxico que a través de la academia de san juan de letrán organizó un concurso para buscar una letra que junto a la música del pianista austriaco henri herz pudiera formar un himno nacional ese primer concurso fue la propuesta más seria hasta el momento incluía entre sus jueces a personajes muy destacados de la época como andrés quintana roo manuel lacunza josé joaquín pesado manuel carpio y alejandro arango y escandón el concurso fue ganado por el estadounidense andrés david bradburn lo cual junto con el contenido de la obra hizo que fuera un verdadero fracaso que terminó por olvidarse poco después en 1850 la misma academia de san juan de letrán realizó su propio concurso para musicalizar un poema del cubano juan miguel lozada la música seleccionada fue obra de nicoláscharles bochsa pero al ser un poema muy centrado en la figura del presidente josé joaquín de herrera no trascendió al parecer durante ese año se dio una especie de competencia informal ya que el músico italiano antonio barilli propuso no solo un himno propuso dos los cuales de ninguna manera fueron del agrado del pueblo mexicano poco después en 1851 otro músico de origen checo max maretzek presentó su propuesta y no fructificó y así se fueron acumulando en tan solo tres años varios intentos en abril de 1853 el italiano inocencio pellegrini presentó su canto nacional sin mucho éxito si es que tuvo alguno en diciembre de 1853 otro músico de apellido infante creó una composición patriótica dedicada a antonio lópez de santa anna la cual solo se tocó una noche otras personalidades que presentaron propuestas formales e informales fueron fernando calderón y beltrán josé maría garmendia francisco manuel sánchez de tagle mariano elízaga y josé maría heredia competencia oficial no se sabe si debido a esa efervescencia o solo por el gusto del entonces presidente y dictador antonio lópez de santa anna el 12 de noviembre de 1853 por medio del diario oficial del gobierno de la república mexicana se dio a conocer un doble concurso cuyo fin y orden seria seleccionar un poema patriótico y su musicalización posterior para formar un himno a la patria  en 1854 se celebraría el 25 aniversario de la victoria de tampico de 1829 cuando antonio lópez de santa anna venció al ejército español en su intento de reconquista buscó santa anna festejar por todo lo alto su gran victoria militar donde alcanzó el rango de general de división el concurso se convocó con la anticipación debida para que el 11 de septiembre del siguiente año se tuviera el himno nacional arreglado para la letra se solicitaba enviar la propuesta en sobre cerrado con un seudónimo al ministerio de fomento colonización industria y comercio en menos de veinte días tras lo cual se tardarían diez días para definir al ganador luego de darse a conocer al ganador la musicalización tendría otro mes para recibir propuestas tras lo cual se tardaría un mes más para dar a conocer al ganador de la música en la misma convocatoria se definía que los derechos de explotación de las propuestas pasarían a manos del gobierno central y solo se entregaría una contraprestación a los ganadores esta convocatoria fue firmada por el entonces oficial mayor del ministerio miguel lerdo de tejada el jurado para la letra estuvo formado por josé bernardo couto manuel carpio y josé joaquín pesado mientras el jurado para la música se integró por josé antonio gómez agustín balderas y tomás león el resultado para la letra se publicó el 4 de febrero de 1854 en el diario oficial junto a la letra siendo ganador el potosino francisco gonzález bocanegra quien luego se supiera realizó la letra encerrado en una habitación por la que era entonces su prometida guadalupe gonzález del pino ya que él no quería participar en el concurso gonzález fue anunciado el ganador en el diario oficial del gobierno de la república mexicana del 3 de febrero de 1854 si bien el himno de gonzález bocanegra es un himno de corte bélico no lo es de ataque agresión ó expansionismo sino todo lo contrario es un himno de defensa de la patria y del territorio nacional seguramente inspirado en el evento militar que se recordaba y festejaba ese año de 1854 al cumplirse 25 años de la invasión española de reconquista el poeta narra en sus estrofas la situación y disposición de los mexicanos y la nación ante una invasión extranjera no así para una guerra intestina y fratricida santa anna el gran vencedor de tampico sería recordado en ese himno santanista que incluso le fue obsequiado por gonzález bocanegra en la dedicatoria la misma noche de su estreno en el gran teatro de santa anna el himno reseña una gran victoria militar contra un extraño enemigo es decir una nación extranjera la única gran victoria con esas características que se celebraba en méxico en esa época era la obtenida en tampico en 1829  como decía la convocatoria tras darse a conocer al ganador de la letra se abrió el concurso de la música se realizó como se decía en un mes siendo ganadora la obra del músico italiano giovanni bottesini pero simplemente no gusto además fue acusado de musicalizar y dar a conocer por fuera del concurso su propuesta lo cual era contrario a los términos del concurso debido a eso el concurso se prolongó hasta los ciento ochenta días mientras el 18 de mayo de 1854 estreno formalmente su propuesta en el teatro santa anna con las voces de la soprano enriqueta sontag y el tenor gaspar pozzolini pero aun así no fue del agrado del público en general tras esa prolongación a ciento ochenta días fue la propuesta del músico español jaime nunó roca la que ganó por entonces nunó era director de las bandas militares del ejército nacional ese puesto lo había logrado por invitación de antonio lópez de santa anna quien lo había conocido en uno de sus varios exilios en cuba su obra con el seudónimo dios y libertad fue declarada ganadora el 12 de agosto de 1854 por medio del diario oficial del gobierno de la república mexicana el himno fue aceptado el día de la independencia del mismo año la interpretación inaugural fue dirigida por giovanni bottesini cantado por claudia florenti y lorenzo salvi en el teatro santa anna poco más de un mes después la noche del 15 de septiembre de 1854 fue interpretado públicamente por primera vez el himno en el entonces famoso teatro santa anna que por entonces cerraba al poniente la calle que hoy se llama 5 de mayo en el hoy llamado centro histórico de la ciudad de méxico que en aquella época era lo único que se llamaba ciudad de méxico luego de algunas palabras del poeta francisco gonzález bocanegra se interpretó el himno dirigido por giovanni bottesini y las voces de claudina florentini lorenzo salvi y coros del teatro a cargo de rené masón y pedro carvajal esa primera vez no fue el estreno oficial ya que solo hasta el día siguiente fue cuando antonio lópez de santa anna en su carácter de presidente asistió a su interpretación por parte de balbina steffenone y lorenzo salvi al contrario de todos los intentos anteriores su éxito fue casi inmediato y su partitura se vendió en las calles su rechazo y aceptación pero no duro mucho su fortuna el 9 de agosto de 1855 antonio lópez de santa anna deja la presidencia por última vez y abandona méxico jaime nunó le sigue a la habana y luego se pierde en los eeuu a la vez francisco gonzález bocanegra se esconde en casa de un tío para evitar represalias y no vuelve ponerse a descubierto del público muere de tifo el 11 de abril de 1861 a sus 37 años la causa de ese repentino cambio es por la llamada revolución de ayutla que desde el 1 de marzo de 1854 venia impulsando un cambio de gobierno federalista y liberal por la revolución de ayutla los grupos liberales y federalistas se hacen del poder e inicia la llamada época de la reforma que traería personajes como benito juárez melchor ocampo ignacio ramírez miguel lerdo de tejada guillermo prieto juan n álvarez e ignacio comonfort como eran contrarios a santa anna hicieron lo posible para que se olvidara el himno santanista si bien no lo prohibieron de ninguna manera alentaron su interpretación pero poco a poco el himno fue ganando adeptos por ejemplo al final de la guerra de reforma cuando las tropas federales retomaban la ciudad de méxico el gral liberal florencio maría del castillo relata que la comitiva se detuvo frente al primer arco para escuchar el himno cuya letra sentimos no haber conseguido terminado el himno fue entonada la marsellesa esa marcha que conmueve los corazones de todos los pueblos y la multitud repitió el estribillo de lo anterior se puede ampliar que hasta la llamada segunda intervención francesa el himno más popular en méxico entre los liberales y muchos otros grupos era la marsellesa y que aun durante la guerra en el segundo imperio mexicano era el himno preferido por benito juárez para ser tocado en su presencia como presidente de méxico otro himno muy popular aunque no fue escrito como tal fue obra de guillermo prieto quien la había escrito como poema satírico en 1853 apareció en su libro de 1854 viajes de orden suprema ese poema musicalizado había sido presentado al concurso santanista por guillermo prieto a través de un tercero y titulada la marcha de los cangrejos obviamente no ganó pero para 1864 al inicio del segundo imperio mexicano ya era una de las canciones más populares en méxico al punto de que el propio emperador maximiliano solicitó que se tocara en su presencia durante una visita a la ciudad de guanajuato en 1864 como una manera de congraciarse con los liberales pero el efecto fue un severo susto e indignación de los grupos conservadores y monárquicos que lo apoyaron para llegar al trono de ese himno informal melchor ocampo cuenta que los cangrejos convertidos en himno popular formulaban el regocijo y el orden y la concordia embellecían un día que lo sobreponen en grandeza a la recepción del ejército trigarantesic otra obra que llegó a ser muy popular y usada como himno fue adiós mamá carlota que solo por su letra no terminó por oficializarse en todo caso al final de la guerra y con la república restaurada el himno santanista volvió a tener presencia si no es que la tuvo durante toda la guerra aunque con varias modificaciones por ejemplo en 1864 el presidente benito juárez discutió con varios sobre ciertas modificaciones a la letra le sugerían suprimir la referencia al guerrero inmortal de zempoala a lo que contesto al himno nacional no se le quita ni una sola nota ni una sola palabra otro cambio que sí perduró fue en la séptima estrofa cambiando si a la lid contra estado enemigo por si a la lid contra hueste enemiga además de muchas otras que no perduraron tras esa época llegó la presidencia de sebastián lerdo de tejada hermano de quien siendo oficial mayor firmó la convocatoria al concurso de 1853 al parecer desde ese momento se impulsó el uso del himno santanista aunque con modificaciones tras la caída de su gobierno por el plan de tuxtepec el nuevo presidente porfirio díaz empezó a usar el himno santanista de común para las ceremonias oficiales siglo xx en 1901 es redescubierto por decirlo de alguna manera el compositor jaime nunó un grupo de mexicanos que estaban de viaje por estados unidos lo encuentra en la ciudad de buffalo nueva york lo dan a conocer al presidente y este lo invita a visitar méxico acepta y durante su visita por primera vez dirige orquesta y coros para interpretar el himno mexicano pero su visita no resulta cálida y regresa a nueva york para entonces era ciudadano estadounidense en 1904 vuelve a ser invitado con motivo de los cincuenta años del himno con mucho más éxito que la visita anterior esa fue la última vez que vivo tocó suelo mexicano ya que muere el 18 de julio de 1908 en bay city nueva jersey durante su primera visita el 11 de febrero de 1901 tras una sesión solemne se anunció que el congreso de la unión concedía a jaime nunó y gonzález bocanegra la cantidad de dos mil pesos de entonces como contraprestación y premio por el concurso de 1853 por parte de gonzález bocanegra el dinero fue recibido por mercedes serralde de gonzález bocanegra como heredera del poeta además a nunó se le dieron los 388 pesos que puso de su bolsillo para hacer la primera tirada de la partitura en 1854 lo cual él ratificó en una entrevista al diario el imparcial del 9 de julio de 1901 durante las celebraciones del centenario de la independencia se vuelve normal el uso del himno santanista y se le empieza a llamar corrientemente como himno nacional méxicano durante la revolución mexicana ya tiene el sello de aprobación popular y oficial pero sin una reglamentación clara se interpreta con las estrofas a gusto del intérprete aunque algunas ya se destacan entre las diez cuatro de ellas en concreto para la llamada guerra cristera incluso se usa por parte del gobierno anticlerical la segunda estrofa que dice de la paz el arcángel divinoque en el cielo tu eterno destinopor el dedo de dios se escribió la primera vez que se grabó el himno en un medio sonoro fue el 28 de julio de 1922 por la cantante duranguense fanny anitúa su versión al decir de muchos fue deficiente y modificada lo que causó gran polémica al grado de requerir una revisión oficial por parte del consejo cultural del distrito federal la revisión fue llevada a cabo por josé lópez portillo y rojas manuel barajas y julián carrillo durante esta revisión se conoció la pérdida de los textos originales entonces el grupo recurrió a la familia de gonzález bocanegra quienes entregaron originales del estribillo y las estrofas también se consiguió una primera edición del himno bajo el sello de la casa murguía en 1854 por otra parte una de las familias pudientes de la época identificada como pérez salas obsequió una instrumentación del himno que el mismo jaime nunó envió a la plana mayor del ejército nacional y a la dirección general de artillería uno de los que pagó con 388 pesos esa revisión demostró los varios cambios que había sufrido el himno así como la dificultad de interpretarlo completo por eso se empezó a limitar el número de estrofas pero sin seguir una formalidad por eso el 4 de mayo de 1943 el entonces presidente de méxico manuel ávila camacho durante la participación de méxico en la segunda guerra mundial promulgó un decreto que oficializaba el himno y lo limitaba a las estrofas i v vi y x más el estribillo por ese decreto se prohibió alterar corregir o modificar la letra o la música ese decreto se formalizó aún más y conjugó con los otros símbolos patrios el 23 de diciembre de 1967 por la ley sobre las características y el uso del escudo la bandera y el himno nacionales ley que fue suprimida en 1984 por la ley sobre el escudo la bandera y el himno nacionales la cual es el ordenamiento que la rige hasta hoy controversias derechos de autor en 1959 la sociedad repertorio wagner s a publicó una partitura para que se pudiera interpretar el himno nacional mexicano por parte de las bandas civiles de música el decreto de 1943 no tenía una partitura anexa y debía conseguirse aparte además de que no era fácil duplicar el decreto esa publicación levantó varios gritos de histeria y terror entre el pueblo mexicano ya que varios periódicos difundieron la supuesta noticia de que wagner era propietaria o se hacía pasar por propietaria del himno nacional debido a eso por ejemplo se dijo que cada lunes los estudiantes debían dar un peso a su escuela para poder interpretar el himno lo que a todas luces es falso de esta manera durante toda su vida el himno ha estado por decirlo ligeramente lleno de bromas de mal gusto incluso en la era del internet como ejemplo de ello está el rumor de que la casa wagner y levien registró el himno nacional mexicano y que por eso cobraba los derechos de ejecución declarándose propietaria de la obra a nivel internacional situación similar pasa en los eeuu con la casa ralph s perr y compañía pero por más desmentido oficial que hace el gobierno mexicano aún sigue el mito en septiembre de 1959 luego de poner una multa a la casa wagner se realizó una investigación para dilucidar si el rumor de que la familia de jaime nunó había vendido los derechos del autor a una casa musical en los eeuu de la investigación se determinó que no existió tal venta de sus derechos de explotación y menos sus derechos de autor aunque luego se encontró que el mismo jaime nunó había vendido en la década de 1850 sus derechos de explotación efectivamente a una casa de música estadounidense pero solo de un arreglo a la música del himno un arreglo para tocar el himno al piano ese arreglo además estaba en otro ritmo y tenor por lo que era muy diferente a la versión original además para 1960 ya habían pasado los cien años que protegía la legislación estadounidense los derechos de explotación y por la misma legislación al ser una obra anterior a 1909 no le aplicaba la ley vigente en 1953 antes de 1909 no existía ley en eeuu que protegiera eso en último caso no transcendía su ley fuera de sus fronteras otra versión de la venta de los derechos de jaime nunó es como sigue el propio nunó y dos estadounidenses harry henneman y phil hill registraron la música de nuñó con la empresa bmi edward b marks music company fue entonces la editora del himno en los eeuu en 1910 y 1911 por lo que luego de encontrarse con las publicaciones de esa casa editorial varios mexicanos empezaron a propagar el rumor sobre que esa casa comercial era la dueña de los derechos de autor no obstante la ley de los derechos de autor en estados unidos declara que el himno mexicano está en el dominio público dentro de los estados unidos dado que tanto la letra como la música fueron estrenadas antes de 1909 además bajo la ley de derechos de autor en méxico el artículo 155 expone que el gobierno tiene los derechos morales pero no el derecho de autor del himno además de que también en méxico está en dominio público ya que se cumplieron los cien años establecidos para su liberación desde el 2008 himno bélico otra polémica muy habitual se basa en que la letra del himno es muy bélica por ejemplo se dice que el estribillo llama a la guerra mexicanos al grito de guerra por lo que varias veces se ha propuesto modificar o cambiar de plano el himno incluso en tiempos recientes el poeta javier sicilia en una entrevista sobre la caravana con justicia y dignidad a la pregunta de también lo preguntaba por el lábaro patrio porque he visto que te molesta el belicismo del himno nacional de méxico respondió sicilia cuando han intentado cantar el himno en el templete de las caravanas yo digo no habría que cambiarlo si lo escuchamos es el problema de no atender a las palabras el himno justifica la guerra necesitamos cambiar la letra esa letra no nos representa fue de un momento histórico y no es el que vivimos estamos en la búsqueda de la paz del amor del reconocimiento de lo humano por encima de las fronteras y nacionessic esa polémica básicamente se ve en personajes de la izquierda mexicana como lo es sicilia es un himno de la derecha en forma paralela sobre el tema belicista del himno esta la polémica sobre su origen santanista ya que antonio lópez de santa anna es uno si no el más odiado personaje de la historia mexicana sobre todo se recuerda su participación en la guerra mexicanaestadounidense y en la guerra texana los principales defensores de esta polémica están en la llamada izquierda mientras los llamados políticos de derecha normalmente defienden el himno como una obra propia de su tiempo que ha ganado su lugar en la historia y estima del pueblo como refuerzo del rechazo al himno se marca su estilo musical conocido como quinta real por su parecido con la marcha real una marcha militar que desde 1791 se usa como himno de españa cine en 1943 cuando se oficializó el himno se estrenó la película mexicanos al grito de guerra dirigida por álvaro gálvez y fuentes e ismael rodríguez y protagonizada por pedro infante y lina montes cuya trama básica es la supuesta historia del himno nacional hasta la batalla del 5 de mayo en puebla en la parte final se muestra a los soldados mexicanos cantando el himno para darse valor pero ningún documento histórico ha podido respaldar esa escena el segundo durante décadas se ha dicho e incluso medios de comunicación han informado que el himno nacional mexicano es considerado el segundo más bello del mundo detrás de la marsellesa pero hasta el día de hoy no se ha llevado a cabo ningún tipo de concurso o competición arbitrada que avale ese dicho incluso es común oír este mito aplicado a otros himnos nacionales como por ejemplo el ecuatoriano colombiano peruano inglés estadounidense etc

presidente manuel ávila camacho la letra del himno alude a victorias mexicanas en batallas y trata sobre la defensa de la patria sus estrofas y estribillo fueron compuestas por el poeta potosino francisco gonzález bocanegra en 1853 mientras que su música obra del músico español jaime nunó fue compuesta al año siguiente en su versión original el himno está compuesto por diez estrofas pero en los noventa años que pasó para su oficialización pasó por varias modificaciones o intentos de modificación quedando reducido solo a cuatro estrofas y el estribillo a partir de 1943 cuando fue oficializado características himno nacional mexicano vocal versión utilizada en radio y televisión problemas al reproducir este archivo las características y uso del himno nacional mexicano está regulada por la ley sobre el escudo la bandera y el himno nacionales en sus artículos 1 4 capítulo v de los artículos 38 a 49 y el capítulo especial de los artículos 57 a 60 y se menciona que el texto del himno y partitura de la música se encuentran autentificados por firma de los titulares de los poderes federales en una copia triple que se deposita para su resguardo en el archivo general de la nación en la biblioteca nacional y en el museo nacional de historia letra la letra oficial del himno mexicano se compone de cuatro estrofas y un estribillo como marca el artículo 57 de la citada ley y

guirnaldas de oliva un recuerdo para ellos de gloria un laurel para ti de victoria un sepulcro para ellos de honor oficialmente en 1943 el texto del himno nacional fue completamente publicado con sus diez estrofas y estribillo pero algunas se recortaron porque hacían referencia a santa anna por eso se recortó a solo cuatro estrofas que son las estrofas i v vi y x de la versión original y el estribillo la modificación de la letra fue ordenada primero por el presidente manuel ávila camacho pero solo se oficializó en 1984 por el presidente miguel de la madrid hurtado a las cuatro estrofas con el fin de hacerlo más fácil de interpretar música en el capítulo especial artículo 58 de la ley se presenta una copia de la partitura de la música del himno consistente básicamente en dos partes

nacional sólo se ejecutará total o parcialmente en actos solemnes de carácter oficial cívico cultural escolar o deportivo  en el caso de las versiones parciales indica que en planteles escolares y eventos deportivos tales como los juegos olímpicos las únicas partes del himno que pueden interpretarse o reproducirse son estribillo y estrofa i otras salvedades son para otros casos como los cierres y aperturas de trasmisiones de estaciones de radio o televisión pueden alterar dentro de las cuatro estrofas oficiales y previa autorización de la secretaría de gobernación la versión que transmiten aunque nunca pueden acortar las versiones completas que se producen durante ceremonias oficiales en ceremonias oficiales en territorio mexicano de instituciones públicas y privadas donde deba tocarse el himno nacional y otro extranjero se ejecutará en primer lugar el mexicano pero si existe un protocolo como en los juegos olímpicos se interpretará de acuerdo al orden que marque el protocolo correspondiente de ese acto por otro lado su uso como distintivo de honor se ejecuta acompañado de otra música por ejemplo para hacer honores al presidente de la república las bandas militares presentes tocarán la marcha de honor el caso de honores a la bandera las bandas de música ejecutarán el himno y a la vez las bandas militares tocarán la marcha llamada bandera y establece un límite a sus interpretaciones en ese caso dos veces para hacer honores a la bandera y rendir honores al presidente de la república aunque se indica la salvedad de que cuando sea interpretado por un coro las bandas militares deberán permanecer en silencio para apagar al coro en cualquier caso los presentes deberán demostrar el respecto asumiendo la posición de firme y en caso de que existan varones deben tener la cabeza descubierta salvedad que se hace con militares que disponen de un ceremonial propio uso en el extranjero en el extranjero las embajadas consulados y legaciones oficiales de la secretaria de relaciones exteriores son las encargadas de la vigilancia de la aplicación de la ley y el respeto al himno nacional evitando su uso comercial y autorizando su interpretación previa consulta con la secretaría de gobernación en situaciones que no sean actos cívicos además de promover su interpretación en actos públicos solemnes realizados por mexicanos además tiene la obligación de solicitar ante el gobierno que está acreditado que prohíba su uso sobre todo si es de carácter comercial en otros idiomas en méxico hay personas que conservan y hablan exclusivamente lenguas indígenas o propias de su cultura de origen desde el 8 de diciembre de 2005 el artículo 39 de la ley permite la traducción de la letra a las lenguas nativas la traducción debe ser sancionada por el instituto nacional de lenguas indígenas y autorizada por la secretaría de gobernación hasta 2014 el himno nacional ha sido traducido a las siguientes lenguas indígenas chinanteco otomí mixteco maya

interpretación del himno por coros infantiles vigilancia en méxico la secretaría de gobernación es la encargada de la vigilancia de la aplicación de la ley aunque se puede ayudar de las demás oficinas del gobierno federal como el caso de la secretaría de relaciones exteriores para otras naciones o la secretaría de educación pública para el caso de la difusión y enseñanza importancia cultural aficionados mexicanos interpretando el himno nacional antes de un partido de fútbol tras la escritura del himno méxico seguía enfrentándose a los efectos de una derrota en una guerra con estados unidos el país se sentía desmoralizado y también dividido debido a la pérdida de aproximadamente la mitad de su territorio el cual le pertenecía ya a estados unidos de acuerdo con el historiador javier garciadiego quien habló en una ceremonia conmemorativa del 150º aniversario de la aprobación del himno en 2004 el himno hace caso omiso a las divisiones y conflictos y anima la unidad nacional en esa misma fecha la ciudad de méxico y otras partes del país detuvieron lo que hacían e interpretaron un canto del himno a nivel nacional individuos de otras naciones participaron también mayoritariamente en las oficinas diplomáticas o en lugares donde se encontraban una alta concentración de expatriados de méxico el himno también ha sido descrito como uno de los símbolos de la identidad mexicana antes de 1820 entre los pueblos prehispánicos no se tiene noticia de que existiera al menos algo parecido a un himno que se identificara unívocamente a algunos de los altépetl pero al llegar las tradiciones europeas tras la llamada conquista española florecieron los llamados himnos religiosos en cuyas letras y música alababan la vida de algún santo o la deidad de la iglesia católica así como los himnos cívicos que trataban de alabar la llegada de virreyes de obispos clérigos la entronización de reyes españoles y más comúnmente la vida de algún personaje o grupo novohispano de entre los autores más destacados de ese tipo de himnos tenemos a manuel de sumaya josé de torres y josé aldana cuya obra religiosa fue profusamente elogiadas en su tiempo y aún hoy destacan de toda su obra los himnos dedicados a la virgen de guadalupe la primera vez que existió en méxico algo muy parecido a un himno nacional fue la llamada marcha real o marcha granadera que desde 1761 se empezó a usar en españa y sus colonias durante las ceremonias cívicas autoría de manuel de espinosa de los monteros fue una obra de cierto agrado que influyo en los años posteriores en el nuevo nacionalismo mexicano que se formó durante la guerra de independencia siglo xix al consumarse la independencia de méxico en 1821 el nuevo nacionalismo mexicano solo impulsó la creación de un escudo y bandera nacional como símbolo del nuevo estado al parecer la idea de un himno nacional no era una necesidad por eso durante la entronización de agustín de iturbide se cantó el himno religioso veni creator en forma especial posteriormente el protocolo de toma del cargo para el primer presidente y vicepresidente de méxico no incluyó ningún himno o canción usada como un himno a pesar de eso durante ese primer medio siglo nunca faltaron propuestas informales de himnos que trataron de tomar el lugar por ejemplo durante la etapa final de la guerra de independencia se realizó un sitio a la ciudad de querétaro por parte de tropas trigarantes entre esas tropas se encontraba un músico llamado josé torrescano quien compuso un himno muy anti español cuya frase más cuestionada era somos independientesviva la libertadviva américa librey viva la igualdad por eso no fue muy promovido el himno ya que la idea del ejército trigarante era lograr la unidad de todos los grupos sociales de la nueva españa ya en lo que se considera el méxico independiente en 1822 otro músico de nombre josé maría garmendía realizó otro himno que no gustó por estar muy centrado en la figura de agustín de iturbide por ejemplo sus primeras palabras eran a las armas valientes indianosa las armas corred con valorel partido seguid de iturbideseamos libres y no haya opresión por eso al cambiar de régimen monárquico a republicano este fue totalmente olvidado luego durante las república tanto federalista como centralista cuando se querían hacer honores al presidente o vicepresidente se interpretaba alguna pieza de su agrado por ejemplo antonio lópez de santa anna gustaba de la obertura semiramis de gioachino rossini mientras josé joaquín de herrera prefería poeta y campesino de franz von suppé el 13 de julio de 1844 otro músico de nombre musicalizó un poema anónimo que honraba a antonio lópez de santa anna quien estaba en su 8º periodo de gobierno durante la república centralista este no gustó al público y terminó olvidado en 1849 luego de la desastrosa guerra mexicanaestadounidense de 1846 a 1848 y durante la presidencia federal de josé joaquín de herrera se formó una llamada junta patriótica de la ciudad de méxico que a través de la academia de san juan de letrán organizó un concurso para buscar una letra que junto a la música del pianista austriaco henri herz pudiera formar un himno nacional ese primer concurso fue la propuesta más seria hasta el momento incluía entre sus jueces a personajes muy destacados de la época como andrés quintana roo manuel lacunza josé joaquín pesado manuel carpio y alejandro arango y escandón el concurso fue ganado por el estadounidense andrés david bradburn lo cual junto con el contenido de la obra hizo que fuera un verdadero fracaso que terminó por olvidarse poco después en 1850 la misma academia de san juan de letrán realizó su propio concurso para musicalizar un poema del cubano juan miguel lozada la música seleccionada fue obra de nicoláscharles bochsa pero al ser un poema muy centrado en la figura del presidente josé joaquín de herrera no trascendió al parecer durante ese año se dio una especie de competencia informal ya que el músico italiano antonio barilli propuso no solo un himno propuso dos los cuales de ninguna manera fueron del agrado del pueblo mexicano poco después en 1851 otro músico de origen checo max maretzek presentó su propuesta y no fructificó y así se fueron acumulando en tan solo tres años varios intentos en abril de 1853 el italiano inocencio pellegrini presentó su canto nacional sin mucho éxito si es que tuvo alguno en diciembre de 1853 otro músico de apellido infante creó una composición patriótica dedicada a antonio lópez de santa anna la cual solo se tocó una noche otras personalidades que presentaron propuestas formales e informales fueron fernando calderón y beltrán josé maría garmendia francisco manuel sánchez de tagle mariano elízaga y josé maría heredia competencia oficial no se sabe si debido a esa efervescencia o solo por el gusto del entonces presidente y dictador antonio lópez de santa anna el 12 de noviembre de 1853 por medio del diario oficial del gobierno de la república mexicana se dio a conocer un doble concurso cuyo fin y orden seria seleccionar un poema patriótico y su musicalización posterior para formar un himno a la patria  en 1854 se celebraría el 25 aniversario de la victoria de tampico de 1829 cuando antonio lópez de santa anna venció al ejército español en su intento de reconquista buscó santa anna festejar por todo lo alto su gran victoria militar donde alcanzó el rango de general de división el concurso se convocó con la anticipación debida para que el 11 de septiembre del siguiente año se tuviera el himno nacional arreglado para la letra se solicitaba enviar la propuesta en sobre cerrado con un seudónimo al ministerio de fomento colonización industria y comercio en menos de veinte días tras lo cual se tardarían diez días para definir al ganador luego de darse a conocer al ganador la musicalización tendría otro mes para recibir propuestas tras lo cual se tardaría un mes más para dar a conocer al ganador de la música en la misma convocatoria se definía que los derechos de explotación de las propuestas pasarían a manos del gobierno central y solo se entregaría una contraprestación a los ganadores esta convocatoria fue firmada por el entonces oficial mayor del ministerio miguel lerdo de tejada el jurado para la letra estuvo formado por josé bernardo couto manuel carpio y josé joaquín pesado mientras el jurado para la música se integró por josé antonio gómez agustín balderas y tomás león el resultado para la letra se publicó el 4 de febrero de 1854 en el diario oficial junto a la letra siendo ganador el potosino francisco gonzález bocanegra quien luego se supiera realizó la letra encerrado en una habitación por la que era entonces su prometida guadalupe gonzález del pino ya que él no quería participar en el concurso gonzález fue anunciado el ganador en el diario oficial del gobierno de la república mexicana del 3 de febrero de 1854 si bien el himno de gonzález bocanegra es un himno de corte bélico no lo es de ataque agresión ó expansionismo sino todo lo contrario es un himno de defensa de la patria y del territorio nacional seguramente inspirado en el evento militar que se recordaba y festejaba ese año de 1854 al cumplirse 25 años de la invasión española de reconquista el poeta narra en sus estrofas la situación y disposición de los mexicanos y la nación ante una invasión extranjera no así para una guerra intestina y fratricida santa anna el gran vencedor de tampico sería recordado en ese himno santanista que incluso le fue obsequiado por gonzález bocanegra en la dedicatoria la misma noche de su estreno en el gran teatro de santa anna el himno reseña una gran victoria militar contra un extraño enemigo es decir una nación extranjera la única gran victoria con esas características que se celebraba en méxico en esa época era la obtenida en tampico en 1829  como decía la convocatoria tras darse a conocer al ganador de la letra se abrió el concurso de la música se realizó como se decía en un mes siendo ganadora la obra del músico italiano giovanni bottesini pero simplemente no gusto además fue acusado de musicalizar y dar a conocer por fuera del concurso su propuesta lo cual era contrario a los términos del concurso debido a eso el concurso se prolongó hasta los ciento ochenta días mientras el 18 de mayo de 1854 estreno formalmente su propuesta en el teatro santa anna con las voces de la soprano enriqueta sontag y el tenor gaspar pozzolini pero aun así no fue del agrado del público en general tras esa prolongación a ciento ochenta días fue la propuesta del músico español jaime nunó roca la que ganó por entonces nunó era director de las bandas militares del ejército nacional ese puesto lo había logrado por invitación de antonio lópez de santa anna quien lo había conocido en uno de sus varios exilios en cuba su obra con el seudónimo dios y libertad fue declarada ganadora el 12 de agosto de 1854 por medio del diario oficial del gobierno de la república mexicana el himno fue aceptado el día de la independencia del mismo año la interpretación inaugural fue dirigida por giovanni bottesini cantado por claudia florenti y lorenzo salvi en el teatro santa anna poco más de un mes después la noche del 15 de septiembre de 1854 fue interpretado públicamente por primera vez el himno en el entonces famoso teatro santa anna que por entonces cerraba al poniente la calle que hoy se llama 5 de mayo en el hoy llamado centro histórico de la ciudad de méxico que en aquella época era lo único que se llamaba ciudad de méxico luego de algunas palabras del poeta francisco gonzález bocanegra se interpretó el himno dirigido por giovanni bottesini y las voces de claudina florentini lorenzo salvi y coros del teatro a cargo de rené masón y pedro carvajal esa primera vez no fue el estreno oficial ya que solo hasta el día siguiente fue cuando antonio lópez de santa anna en su carácter de presidente asistió a su interpretación por parte de balbina steffenone y lorenzo salvi al contrario de todos los intentos anteriores su éxito fue casi inmediato y su partitura se vendió en las calles su rechazo y aceptación pero no duro mucho su fortuna el 9 de agosto de 1855 antonio lópez de santa anna deja la presidencia por última vez y abandona méxico jaime nunó le sigue a la habana y luego se pierde en los eeuu a la vez francisco gonzález bocanegra se esconde en casa de un tío para evitar represalias y no vuelve ponerse a descubierto del público muere de tifo el 11 de abril de 1861 a sus 37 años la causa de ese repentino cambio es por la llamada revolución de ayutla que desde el 1 de marzo de 1854 venia impulsando un cambio de gobierno federalista y liberal por la revolución de ayutla los grupos liberales y federalistas se hacen del poder e inicia la llamada época de la reforma que traería personajes como benito juárez melchor ocampo ignacio ramírez miguel lerdo de tejada guillermo prieto juan n álvarez e ignacio comonfort como eran contrarios a santa anna hicieron lo posible para que se olvidara el himno santanista si bien no lo prohibieron de ninguna manera alentaron su interpretación pero poco a poco el himno fue ganando adeptos por ejemplo al final de la guerra de reforma cuando las tropas federales retomaban la ciudad de méxico el gral liberal florencio maría del castillo relata que la comitiva se detuvo frente al primer arco para escuchar el himno cuya letra sentimos no haber conseguido terminado el himno fue entonada la marsellesa esa marcha que conmueve los corazones de todos los pueblos y la multitud repitió el estribillo de lo anterior se puede ampliar que hasta la llamada segunda intervención francesa el himno más popular en méxico entre los liberales y muchos otros grupos era la marsellesa y que aun durante la guerra en el segundo imperio mexicano era el himno preferido por benito juárez para ser tocado en su presencia como presidente de méxico otro himno muy popular aunque no fue escrito como tal fue obra de guillermo prieto quien la había escrito como poema satírico en 1853 apareció en su libro de 1854 viajes de orden suprema ese poema musicalizado había sido presentado al concurso santanista por guillermo prieto a través de un tercero y titulada la marcha de los cangrejos obviamente no ganó pero para 1864 al inicio del segundo imperio mexicano ya era una de las canciones más populares en méxico al punto de que el propio emperador maximiliano solicitó que se tocara en su presencia durante una visita a la ciudad de guanajuato en 1864 como una manera de congraciarse con los liberales pero el efecto fue un severo susto e indignación de los grupos conservadores y monárquicos que lo apoyaron para llegar al trono de ese himno informal melchor ocampo cuenta que los cangrejos convertidos en himno popular formulaban el regocijo y el orden y la concordia embellecían un día que lo sobreponen en grandeza a la recepción del ejército trigarantesic otra obra que llegó a ser muy popular y usada como himno fue adiós mamá carlota que solo por su letra no terminó por oficializarse en todo caso al final de la guerra y con la república restaurada el himno santanista volvió a tener presencia si no es que la tuvo durante toda la guerra aunque con varias modificaciones por ejemplo en 1864 el presidente benito juárez discutió con varios sobre ciertas modificaciones a la letra le sugerían suprimir la referencia al guerrero inmortal de zempoala a lo que contesto al himno nacional no se le quita ni una sola nota ni una sola palabra otro cambio que sí perduró fue en la séptima estrofa cambiando si a la lid contra estado enemigo por si a la lid contra hueste enemiga además de muchas otras que no perduraron tras esa época llegó la presidencia de sebastián lerdo de tejada hermano de quien siendo oficial mayor firmó la convocatoria al concurso de 1853 al parecer desde ese momento se impulsó el uso del himno santanista aunque con modificaciones tras la caída de su gobierno por el plan de tuxtepec el nuevo presidente porfirio díaz empezó a usar el himno santanista de común para las ceremonias oficiales siglo xx en 1901 es redescubierto por decirlo de alguna manera el compositor jaime nunó un grupo de mexicanos que estaban de viaje por estados unidos lo encuentra en la ciudad de buffalo nueva york lo dan a conocer al presidente y este lo invita a visitar méxico acepta y durante su visita por primera vez dirige orquesta y coros para interpretar el himno mexicano pero su visita no resulta cálida y regresa a nueva york para entonces era ciudadano estadounidense en 1904 vuelve a ser invitado con motivo de los cincuenta años del himno con mucho más éxito que la visita anterior esa fue la última vez que vivo tocó suelo mexicano ya que muere el 18 de julio de 1908 en bay city nueva jersey durante su primera visita el 11 de febrero de 1901 tras una sesión solemne se anunció que el congreso de la unión concedía a jaime nunó y gonzález bocanegra la cantidad de dos mil pesos de entonces como contraprestación y premio por el concurso de 1853 por parte de gonzález bocanegra el dinero fue recibido por mercedes serralde de gonzález bocanegra como heredera del poeta además a nunó se le dieron los 388 pesos que puso de su bolsillo para hacer la primera tirada de la partitura en 1854 lo cual él ratificó en una entrevista al diario el imparcial del 9 de julio de 1901 durante las celebraciones del centenario de la independencia se vuelve normal el uso del himno santanista y se le empieza a llamar corrientemente como himno nacional méxicano durante la revolución mexicana ya tiene el sello de aprobación popular y oficial pero sin una reglamentación clara se interpreta con las estrofas a gusto del intérprete aunque algunas ya se destacan entre las diez cuatro de ellas en concreto para la llamada guerra cristera incluso se usa por parte del gobierno anticlerical la segunda estrofa que dice de la paz el arcángel divinoque en el cielo tu eterno destinopor el dedo de dios se escribió la primera vez que se grabó el himno en un medio sonoro fue el 28 de julio de 1922 por la cantante duranguense fanny anitúa su versión al decir de muchos fue deficiente y modificada lo que causó gran polémica al grado de requerir una revisión oficial por parte del consejo cultural del distrito federal la revisión fue llevada a cabo por josé lópez portillo y rojas manuel barajas y julián carrillo durante esta revisión se conoció la pérdida de los textos originales entonces el grupo recurrió a la familia de gonzález bocanegra quienes entregaron originales del estribillo y las estrofas también se consiguió una primera edición del himno bajo el sello de la casa murguía en 1854 por otra parte una de las familias pudientes de la época identificada como pérez salas obsequió una instrumentación del himno que el mismo jaime nunó envió a la plana mayor del ejército nacional y a la dirección general de artillería uno de los que pagó con 388 pesos esa revisión demostró los varios cambios que había sufrido el himno así como la dificultad de interpretarlo completo por eso se empezó a limitar el número de estrofas pero sin seguir una formalidad por eso el 4 de mayo de 1943 el entonces presidente de méxico manuel ávila camacho durante la participación de méxico en la segunda guerra mundial promulgó un decreto que oficializaba el himno y lo limitaba a las estrofas i v vi y x más el estribillo por ese decreto se prohibió alterar corregir o modificar la letra o la música ese decreto se formalizó aún más y conjugó con los otros símbolos patrios el 23 de diciembre de 1967 por la ley sobre las características y el uso del escudo la bandera y el himno nacionales ley que fue suprimida en 1984 por la ley sobre el escudo la bandera y el himno nacionales la cual es el ordenamiento que la rige hasta hoy controversias derechos de autor en 1959 la sociedad repertorio wagner s a publicó una partitura para que se pudiera interpretar el himno nacional mexicano por parte de las bandas civiles de música el decreto de 1943 no tenía una partitura anexa y debía conseguirse aparte además de que no era fácil duplicar el decreto esa publicación levantó varios gritos de histeria y terror entre el pueblo mexicano ya que varios periódicos difundieron la supuesta noticia de que wagner era propietaria o se hacía pasar por propietaria del himno nacional debido a eso por ejemplo se dijo que cada lunes los estudiantes debían dar un peso a su escuela para poder interpretar el himno lo que a todas luces es falso de esta manera durante toda su vida el himno ha estado por decirlo ligeramente lleno de bromas de mal gusto incluso en la era del internet como ejemplo de ello está el rumor de que la casa wagner y levien registró el himno nacional mexicano y que por eso cobraba los derechos de ejecución declarándose propietaria de la obra a nivel internacional situación similar pasa en los eeuu con la casa ralph s perr y compañía pero por más desmentido oficial que hace el gobierno mexicano aún sigue el mito en septiembre de 1959 luego de poner una multa a la casa wagner se realizó una investigación para dilucidar si el rumor de que la familia de jaime nunó había vendido los derechos del autor a una casa musical en los eeuu de la investigación se determinó que no existió tal venta de sus derechos de explotación y menos sus derechos de autor aunque luego se encontró que el mismo jaime nunó había vendido en la década de 1850 sus derechos de explotación efectivamente a una casa de música estadounidense pero solo de un arreglo a la música del himno un arreglo para tocar el himno al piano ese arreglo además estaba en otro ritmo y tenor por lo que era muy diferente a la versión original además para 1960 ya habían pasado los cien años que protegía la legislación estadounidense los derechos de explotación y por la misma legislación al ser una obra anterior a 1909 no le aplicaba la ley vigente en 1953 antes de 1909 no existía ley en eeuu que protegiera eso en último caso no transcendía su ley fuera de sus fronteras otra versión de la venta de los derechos de jaime nunó es como sigue el propio nunó y dos estadounidenses harry henneman y phil hill registraron la música de nuñó con la empresa bmi edward b marks music company fue entonces la editora del himno en los eeuu en 1910 y 1911 por lo que luego de encontrarse con las publicaciones de esa casa editorial varios mexicanos empezaron a propagar el rumor sobre que esa casa comercial era la dueña de los derechos de autor no obstante la ley de los derechos de autor en estados unidos declara que el himno mexicano está en el dominio público dentro de los estados unidos dado que tanto la letra como la música fueron estrenadas antes de 1909 además bajo la ley de derechos de autor en méxico el artículo 155 expone que el gobierno tiene los derechos morales pero no el derecho de autor del himno además de que también en méxico está en dominio público ya que se cumplieron los cien años establecidos para su liberación desde el 2008 himno bélico otra polémica muy habitual se basa en que la letra del himno es muy bélica por ejemplo se dice que el estribillo llama a la guerra mexicanos al grito de guerra por lo que varias veces se ha propuesto modificar o cambiar de plano el himno incluso en tiempos recientes el poeta javier sicilia en una entrevista sobre la caravana con justicia y dignidad a la pregunta de también lo preguntaba por el lábaro patrio porque he visto que te molesta el belicismo del himno nacional de méxico respondió sicilia cuando han intentado cantar el himno en el templete de las caravanas yo digo no habría que cambiarlo si lo escuchamos es el problema de no atender a las palabras el himno justifica la guerra necesitamos cambiar la letra esa letra no nos representa fue de un momento histórico y no es el que vivimos estamos en la búsqueda de la paz del amor del reconocimiento de lo humano por encima de las fronteras y nacionessic esa polémica básicamente se ve en personajes de la izquierda mexicana como lo es sicilia es un himno de la derecha en forma paralela sobre el tema belicista del himno esta la polémica sobre su origen santanista ya que antonio lópez de santa anna es uno si no el más odiado personaje de la historia mexicana sobre todo se recuerda su participación en la guerra mexicanaestadounidense y en la guerra texana los principales defensores de esta polémica están en la llamada izquierda mientras los llamados políticos de derecha normalmente defienden el himno como una obra propia de su tiempo que ha ganado su lugar en la historia y estima del pueblo como refuerzo del rechazo al himno se marca su estilo musical conocido como quinta real por su parecido con la marcha real una marcha militar que desde 1791 se usa como himno de españa cine en 1943 cuando se oficializó el himno se estrenó la película mexicanos al grito de guerra dirigida por álvaro gálvez y fuentes e ismael rodríguez y protagonizada por pedro infante y lina montes cuya trama básica es la supuesta historia del himno nacional hasta la batalla del 5 de mayo en puebla en la parte final se muestra a los soldados mexicanos cantando el himno para darse valor pero ningún documento histórico ha podido respaldar esa escena el segundo durante décadas se ha dicho e incluso medios de comunicación han informado que el himno nacional mexicano es considerado el segundo más bello del mundo detrás de la marsellesa pero hasta el día de hoy no se ha llevado a cabo ningún tipo de concurso o competición arbitrada que avale ese dicho incluso es común oír este mito aplicado a otros himnos nacionales como por ejemplo el ecuatoriano colombiano peruano inglés estadounidense etc

第二批派往f市的纪检人员进行了更为艰苦和细致的工作花费了更长的时间最终的调查结果与前次的结论基本一致 当地群众和知情者的举报材料又一次传递到了决策层用大量的事实证明前两批派出的专案组工作人员均不同程度地接受了当地官员的好处已经被腐蚀下水了因此他们实际上变成了犯罪同谋或者说是替涉嫌走私的官员们充当了保护伞 一定要揭开f市的这个顽固的盖子最高层的决心不可动摇于是第三批官员在精心选拔和严格考验之后立即奔赴f市他们发誓要把走私案的真相搞个水落石出 效果非常明显f市委市政府海关税务等等部门的防线被一一突破走私案数额之巨大情节之严重影响之恶劣涉及面之广拉下水的干部之多级别职务之高均令人发指公诸于世必将震惊全国 是否继续深查查上面的态度依然坚决专案组已经连续奋战了两个多月非常辛苦差不多是昼夜不停地干 牵扯的官员太多了几乎找不到与此事无关的人了 一些官员在强大的攻心战面前开始动摇了不少人主动找专案组坦白自首争取宽大处理 质检局二处的副处长王二在经过激烈的思想斗争后决定尽快解脱他为这件事已经有二十多天没睡个安稳觉了他知道自己已触犯了刑律后果是严重的他的老婆也没完没了地数落着骂他不知好歹他的精神快要崩溃了与其惶惶不可终日不如主动坦白交代该杀该关尽早有个了断他下了决心咬紧牙关硬着头皮走进了专案组的住地 大厅和走廊里挤满了人这是规定自首期限的最后一天他低着头唯恐碰见熟人但尴尬的情景还是躲不过有人主动和他打招呼他抬起头来发现排在他前面和后面的人当中有十多位是他的同事和朋友 终于轮到他了他脸色惨白两腿颤抖地走到专案组干部的桌前结结巴巴地报上姓名单位和职务 说你犯了什么事儿坐在桌子后面的纪检干部一边做笔记一边大声喝问 我受贿三万元他差一点哭出来 多少三万那人重复了一遍 是三万他吓得快咽气了 真的那专案组的干部眼睛直盯着他 真的王二咬了咬牙 哈哈终于碰到一个廉洁的干部啦那位年轻的纪检干部兴奋地搓着手 王二满头雾水地呆坐在那里两只耳朵嗡嗡直响他张了张嘴嗓子眼干得快冒烟了一句话也说不出来 一位检察官走过来用手使劲儿地拍了拍他的肩膀说你还待在这儿干什么还不赶快帮我们干活儿去我们早就想找个帮手了可这儿全是他妈的贪官信不过啊就你廉洁符合条件留下来跟我们一快查案子吧 王二当天就成了专案组的协办人员 18英镑 老陈处长对英国印象很不好他几乎骂了一路 他觉得英国人已退化为农民了只是还穿着西装扎着领带而已工业革命的年代早就成为遥远的回声了留给后人的只是祖上曾经有过的沸腾岁月的模糊追忆 老陈说这英国的确是老牌资本主义专跟社会主义拧着来对着干我们是右侧通行他们非得靠左边走方向盘安的位置也正好跟我们相反就连电插座也搞得怪怪的中国拿来的插头甭想插进去 最让老陈无法容忍的是英镑他说这英棒镑比这世上所有的警棍铁棒都厉害一棒镑就能致命老陈平时在国内就怕花钱老婆逛商店他拒绝陪同因为他的心脏承受不了看老婆上收银台付款的那一刻老婆知道老陈有这个毛病所以就连水电费之类的小钱也由自己去交 老陈一辈了没请过客也没入党请客怕花钱入党要交党费就这一条就改变了他的政治选择老陈这次出国是单位掏的钱除了机票在国外的交通和吃住是包干的每天75镑超支不补节余归已老陈爱算计数字反应能力快他马上意识到这笔钱折合成人民币可不是一个小数目75镑相当于1125块钱十天下来就是一万多块钱呢如果单位把这笔钱发给他的话他宁肯不出国了当然不出国谁还给你钱呢 与老陈一块儿出去的还有几个人住宿得往一块儿安排这使老陈很郁闷按他的想法条件好一点差一点不都是睡个觉嘛有张床就不错了何必两人一个房间呢每天30英镑这在英国的旅馆里已经是很低档的了可在老陈眼里这无疑是往水里扔钱心疼得他直捂胸口他还跟同行的人说你们想住就住吧我躺桥洞底下或走廊里睡得更香 吃的问题好解决老陈备足了方便面一天三袋他正好带了45袋方便面得用开水泡老陈想得周到从国内带三个热得快可事不凑巧老陈住的那家旅馆里的插座是方孔的老陈的插头派不上用场急得他口吐白沫他一气之下索性把方便面干嚼了然后再喝点自来水因为矿泉水的价钱他打听过了最便宜的也是一镑一瓶太贵了英国人是名副其实的强盗当年到世界各地去横枪掠夺现在还是在抢一英镑等于15块人民币就为一喝口水太不像话啦我宁可渴死也不喝他们的金水老陈气鼓鼓地发着誓 喝自来水老陈害怕坏肚子就吃上一片黄连素所以黄连素就水吃是老陈每天必做的功课 英国的物价对于中国人来说肯定是昂贵的这个道理很简单英镑与人民币的比价是115英镑是人民币的15倍一般说来这意味着英国的物价比中国要高出若干倍来老陈对此一直耿耿于怀愤愤不平他骂这些狗日的经济学家整天尽放狗屁凭什么说英镑那么值钱他们全是些狗屎替帝国主义资本主义效力尽做一些坑害我们中国人民的丧尽天良的事 住旅馆吃饭等有时需要付点小费一次一两镑就够了这是英国的习惯而这个习惯是老陈最不能容忍和遵守的他说凭什么给小费宿费餐费我都付了打扫房间端盘子是他们应做的本职工作习惯什么臭习惯我非得改改他们的这个坏毛病不可也让他们有一点为人民服务的精神谁爱付谁付我就是不给难道不给小费他们还能把我抓进监狱啊 老陈出国半个月骂了十五天终于省下了几百英镑回家后的头一件事就是跑到厕所里脱了裤子然后把攒下来那些英镑从最隐秘处掏了出来光着屁股兴冲冲地跑到老婆跟前直摇晃他老婆误会了以为老陈离开半个月竟产生了强烈的生理要求了呢老陈冲着满脸通红目光诧异的老婆不停地抖动着手里的那一叠钱快看啊这是英镑英镑真他妈的棒 19幸福百分百 受一个半官方组织的委托由五十多位专业人士组成的课题组要展开一项关于老年人幸福感问题的专项调研委托方是一个全国性的协会承担者则是大学里的教授副教授讲师以及他们的研究生们组成 此项调查的目的是为了及时而准确地了解城市人口中的老龄人当下的生活状况进而为政策制定者提供第一手真实材料作为他们的决策依据提高其解决问题的针对性摸清情况是科学决策的第一步委托方的负责人反复强调这一点他说这句话时声音极其诚恳标准的语重心长 调研组根据委托者的要求认真仔细地商定调查的方法数以亿计的老年人分布在城市与乡村普查是力不从心的况且调查的经费十分有限只能采取抽查的办法来完成为方便取样他们决定选取四个大城市中的二十个社区来进行每个社区随机选取十位老人登门访谈以获取最真实的信息 小组分兵四路奔赴四大城市有一个难题摆在了课题组的面前没有上级主管部门的介绍信或口头通知社区居委会对于课题组均不予以接待于是他们分别去居委会的上级部门街道办事处去请求帮助而街道办事处则要求专家们去找更上级的领导批示区里又请示了市里的民政部门最后花了一周的时间才把关系理顺手续补齐 教授副教授们带领的调查小组试图在每个城市随机抽取五个社区展开工作但市里说你们人生地不熟的连居委会的名字都说不上来这等于瞎子摸象我们也搞不清社区居委会的分布不如推荐一个区你们找他们联系为好 区里热情地接待了他们相关领导在听取了调查小组的意见后同样认为这个思路有问题因为有的街道的领导办事拖拉或公务繁忙不一定能接待好调查组于是区里指定了几个办事能力相对较强的办事处负责协助调查组的工作出于同样的考虑街道办事处又把调查组的专家们引荐给了工作成绩突出的社区居委会一切都顺理成章 居委会冲着上级的面子和信任殷勤周到地接待远方而来的客人 所到之处的社区居委会办公条件堪称一流会议室的墙壁上挂满了奖状锦旗以及各种规章制度标语口号和便民服务措施等居委会的负责人几乎全都是中年女性且一律面带笑容热情好客不停地劝专家们喝茶吃水果嗑瓜子 当得知调查组的意图后她们纷纷表示要积极配合没问题别说找十位老头老太太就要找二十三十位也不费吹灰之力你们不必辛苦了我们把他们喊来就行了 当调查组的师生们说我们想采取走门串户的方式进行个别访谈时居委会的主任还是满腔热忱地表示那更没问题我给你们带路陪你们去一家一家地访谈 调查组的几个人小声交换了一下意见认为这种调查方式不一定能了解到真实的情况就婉拒了居委会干部们的好意坚持自己入户访问 那怎么行呢居委会主任显然不同意这种做法你们又不认识他们姓什名谁住在哪楼哪号两眼一抹黑地误打误撞弄不好让人当是坏人了呢这法子不行 您能把社区老人的花名册给我们看看吗我们想做非概率抽样带队的教授提议道 啥您说啥非啥抽样居委会主任没听过这个说法 噢就是我们想从老年人花名册上随便选十个人然后去访谈您觉得怎样教授解释说 那敢情好主任让工作人员很快找出了一个硬皮夹子翻开后摊到教授面前您自己瞧吧社区的老头老太太全在这里了你们自己选吧 于是调查组的师生们围在一起指指点点地选定了十位老人的名字 噢这个人不行早就老糊涂了就是老年痴呆了连老婆都不认识了没法回答你们的问题这个胡老太也不成大小便失禁床上拉屎尿的那屋子根本就进不去人比公共厕所还臭呢还有这个曲老头儿也说不了话他年轻时就哑巴了耳朵聋的连煤气罐爆炸了也听不见去年差一点被炸死这个霍大爷更不成早就不住在这儿了他让儿子儿媳撵走了那间两居室的房子生生被儿子霸占了这几个也没选对一个去年冬天煤气中毒死在家里开了春才被发现尸体都腐烂了还有一个是上个月下楼时不小心摔死的这两个人的户口怎么还没销掉呢应该从花名册上涂掉的小王你也太马虎了还有这位就喜欢拣垃圾天天睡在垃圾堆里你们根本就找不着他还是我们帮你们选吧这不怪你们你们是外人不像我们熟悉情况对他们我们可关心啦 调查组又重新选了几个还是有这样那样的问题不适合访谈 最后只能按照居委会的建议确定了十个人的名字调查组的成员一一登门做了调查 这十位老人的身体健康状况都很好而且精神状态也很积极他们个个对晚年的生活都相当满意幸福感溢于言表并不断夸奖现行的老年人优待政策以及各级政府特别是社区居委会无微不至的关怀 四路调查小组分别汇总了调查情况在科学分析的基础上得出的结论是城市老年人的幸福感是百分之百 20重要情况

直到有一天主任太太气势汹汹地冲进资料室指着陆小姐破口大骂并把所有肮脏恶毒的词汇倾泻到陆小姐身上传言才被证实 陆小姐走出资料室时两眼红肿着尽管她竭力辩解但依然掩饰不住那种暧昧的态度 系里的老师们议论纷纷猜测事件发生时的情景那些刚听到传言时不以为然的人开始动摇当初的看法认为这世界太奇怪了竟然会发生这么不可思议的事情 陆小姐是一位老姑娘大学毕业后留在系里的资料室工作她性情内向少言寡语再加上相貌平平或者可以说是长相偏丑根本无人问津平时她几乎是一个人关在书架当中整理各类文摘卡片和图书目录很少与人打交道系里的男女老师也很少有兴趣主动与她打招呼她怎么会与系主任发生如此浪漫的故事呢真是令人费解 令人难以置信的还有一层意思系主任是留学归来的博士不光学术精湛而且风度翩翩趣味高雅仰慕追随者中不乏才貌俱佳的美女有教师也有学生他从不招收女研究生据说就是怕惹此类麻烦当然只要他太太在他即使有这个念头也没那个胆量可是他却偏偏染指了陆小姐 系里的老师们百思不得其解一些年轻的女教师和女研究生们更是愤愤不平 她们一致认为这是典型的丑闻陆小姐本身长得就丑部分女教师女研究生们对她们曾经倾心爱慕的系主任的所作所为或痛心疾首或嗤之以鼻嘲笑留美博士的品位也不过如此她们中更多的人对陆小姐既厌恶仇恨又嫉妒羡慕但绝不原谅同情 陆小姐低着头尽量回避投向她的种种感情复杂的目光她在洗手间洗了洗脸悄悄地回到资料室的阅览桌旁像往常一样静静地做着她的本职工作隔壁和走廊里时而传来的哄笑声并没有影响她的正常工作 下班后陆小姐回到了她的单身宿舍对着镜子她的脸上露出了一丝古怪的笑容她感谢天赐的良机前些日子若不是系主任为了参加学术会议而急着准备论文让她帮助查阅文献资料她恐怕一生都没有机会接近他正是这个难得的机会使她萌生了制造绯闻的冲动她自己用计算机将浪漫风流的故事打好并寄发给有关人士包括那位醋意浓浓的主任太太 陆小姐对着镜子又一次开心地笑了她渴望这个绯闻能继续下去作为桃色事件的女主人公她将继续成为人们关注的焦点

按照房地产开发商的说法现代人的居家理念应彻底改变买房子主要是买环境买邻居环境优美邻居高贵自然能提升人的品位和房子的价格开发商要赚钱消费者要改善居住条件二者不谋而合寻找好邻居达到双赢 我对买房子就是买邻居的主张格外拥护并费了很多唾沫说服劝诱我那观念守旧死不开窍的老婆为了让她搬家我从孟母三迁的典故说起整整用了一个月的工夫把嘴皮子愣是磨破了终于让她相信拥有一个好邻居简直就是一笔财富当然是无形资产不像我现在的这些邻居一个个蓬头垢面贼眉鼠眼与他们为伍八辈子也不会成为受人尊重的名流 我开始寻找有好邻居的住宅什么是好邻居呢当然是有名望的人物我和老婆最大的理想是选择一处前后左右分别住着著名歌唱家作家科学家和公安局长这种邻居的地方我希望我女儿的哑嗓子能在歌唱家免费的歌声熏陶下发出悦耳动听的声音我们还打算她能与著名作家的儿子交往说不定会得到作家的亲自指导用不了多久就会在某项全国作文大奖赛中脱颖而出科学家邻居肯定是位热心人而且独具慧眼只要经他一点拨我孩子就会茅塞顿开大彻大悟到那时看我怎么教训她的数学老师他有一次竟敢当着全班同学的面骂我女儿是个白痴还断定她是父母近亲结婚的产物至于选择公安局长做邻居这个道理我不说别人也会知道图个安全呗与这种有权有势的人物做邻居谁还敢碰咱连防盗门都不用安没准儿有人送礼认错了门儿我们还能白捞个意外之财呢 我跑遍了名人住宅四处打听歌唱家作家科学家和公安局长的住址呸没人肯告诉我们有人还说我得了脑炎应该找个医生当邻居乍一听我觉得挺有道理后来一琢磨敢情是骂我我是得过脑炎那是小时候的事儿现在的我智商早超出了一般人哪个不服气比比看到底谁的钱多呸 我终于找到了一处叫做名人豪居的住宅住了下来虽然周围的房子还都空着我相信用不了多长时间歌唱家名作家科学家和公安局长就会搬过来 不到一个月我隔壁的那套房子就有人入住了打眼一看就知道是位知名人士但说不准是艺术界还是科学界的只要他或她一练嗓子我保准儿能区别出来 果然不出我所料这位邻居是位音乐家从进住的当天起他家白天黑夜都开着音响那声音把我家客厅新安装的吊顶灯都给震下来了 我很想结识这位邻居但一直没见他出门贸然拜访又怕人笑话正当我在屋子里想辙的时候门铃响了我一开门正是我那位名流邻居我赶紧把他迎进客厅没等我开口邻居便问您是导演吧噢不不那您是作家吗噢不不那您肯定是歌唱家或者市长喽不不您别客气邻居从兜里掏出个精美的笔记本不管您是什么家都请您帮我签个名我儿子就是冲着这里住着的邻居都是名人才逼着我买下这座房子的呸我把他赶了出去 后来我周围的那几间空房子都搬进了住户我家的门铃被按响了许多次每一次都是让我签名我无法满足他们的要求最亏的是我我本想在我的名片上印上名人之邻居的字样但至今未能实现 4证书 招聘会上我满头大汗地挤到了面试台前 坐吧公司负责招聘事务的工作人员示意我坐下她胸前挂着个小牌上面写着人力资源部总监我瞟了一眼 身份证呢 在这儿我慌忙递过去 暂住证办了吗 办了我从上衣口袋里翻出个小本本 毕业证 有我赶紧拿出来

没有啦我们这是物业公司主要招聘保洁人员她很肯定 保洁员也要那么多的证书我有些不理解 当然啦我们需要的是复合型人才是高素质的清洁工她很自豪 我没有美容师心理咨询师的证书能胜任这个岗位吗我真替自己的能力担心 啊你误会了这两种证书暂时不需要我只是替我的一位朋友顺便打听一下她托我搞两个证书好去应聘一个保姆的岗位 5富人 现在的富人多了要找个穷人可真难哪 我有一个朋友住在豪门名居据说为找一个穷人跑遍了老少边穷地区费尽了九牛二虎之力最后好不容易花重金雇到了一位聘期一年他本来是想终身聘用的可那个穷小子死活不干说是还有别人三年前就排队争着聘他不能见利忘义 聘来的穷小子专门坐在小区的大门口乞讨这是按聘用协议他必须干的工作 每天上下班的时候住在小区里的富豪们进进出出总忘不了往乞丐面前摆放的大塑料桶里扔钱有一张一张扔的还有一捆一捆扔的乞丐跪在那里不停地向过往行人磕头 乞丐开始时还挺兴奋每天按时到岗时间长了他也麻木了对这份收入丰厚的工作不以为然隔三差五地休休假旷旷工这可惹恼了豪门名居的所有住户他们有钱没处撒憋得心里起泡泡大伙儿群起而攻之大骂乞丐缺乏敬业精神乞丐受不了这份窝囊气干脆撂挑子不干了扬言要回老家去这下子大富豪们个个傻了眼要知道这年头找一个穷人比找个处女都难他们只好低三下四地求乞丐苦苦相劝希望他能留下来因为富人太需要穷人来衬托了 富豪大款们轮番做乞丐的思想工作并提出种种诱人的条件最后那个穷小子总算勉强答应了不过他又提出了两个新条件一是双休日他要休假二是不能只往桶里扔纸钞那样时间长了他听不到声响容易犯困打盹要往桶里扔金银珠宝之类的东西以便发出悦耳的声音富翁们终于松了口气纷纷表示一定会满足穷汉的要求但同时希望乞丐能穿得再破一点尽可能显得可怜兮兮的还要说一些令人心碎的辛酸话乞丐也同意了 接下来的大半年时间小区门口叮叮当当噼噼啪啪的声音不绝于耳雇来的乞丐不停地向行人磕头蓬头垢面衣衫褴褛口中念念有词可怜可怜我吧我三天水米未进啦我快饿死啦您瞧我瘦成啥样啦等等偶尔也能听到行人的一两句答话三天没吃饭真行我要是像你那么有毅力就不会胖成这样啦 我的那位朋友是在请我吃饭的时候给我讲这段故事的他瞪着两眼向我发誓说这绝对是真事没有半点瞎话吃完饭后他一摸口袋说出门时把所有的钱连同钱包都扔给了那个乞丐于是我买了单那顿饭只花了几百块钱 6激励 二十年前我活得很沮丧 与我同龄的人差不多都快大学毕业了我仍在复读班里年复一年地准备高考屡败屡战与屡战屡败信心与现实之间只隔着一层自欺欺人的面纱 我终于放弃了徒劳的努力在父母与亲人的失望和责备的压力下挣扎着我自虐般地选择了去小煤窑挖煤的苦役用身体和汗水来换取生存的基本条件 非法开采被禁止了我拖着一条残腿替养殖场的老板摇橹烈日的暴晒强风的吹袭我的相貌比实际年龄要显老许多 同学们一个个开始在商界和官场中崭露头角了我羡慕地疏远了他们 有一年同学们聚在了一起那是一个五一节劳动人民的节日我经过激烈的思想斗争之后还是应邀参加了我心里十分清楚同学聚会是成功者的展示会那里需要失败者的衬托我愿意充当这一卑怜的角色 大家像打擂台一样地自我炫耀着惟恐不能尽情发挥浮夸风愈刮愈烈我躲在一个角落里充分享受了同学们一致的冷落就在我绝望地准备离开的时候他当时我们班最富有的成功者人称关老板的走了过来他已是深圳一家大公司的高层主管他的一位朋友病了住在医院里他事先并不知道由于他来时没带多少现金所以手里没钱去探望病人他诚恳地希望我能借给他一千块钱我半信半疑地回家取了钱并交给了他 事隔不久他把钱汇给了我若干年后我们又一次相遇那是一次企业家的高层论坛他当着与会企业家们的面对着话筒说老马帮助了我在我最困难的时候他借给了我一千块钱 我感动的眼圈湿润了在心里大声喊是你帮助了我如果不是你向我借那一千块钱我会认为自己一钱不值我也绝不会有今天 7情况反映 我写了份情况反映准备寄给北京的一家报社 为了写好这份情况反映我花了整整一个星期的时间向上级和媒体反映情况一定要客观真实不能有任何水分我为此做了充分的准备各类数据和事例都在动笔之前作了反复的核实援引的上级文件和领导讲话我也一一做了校对在确保一切都准确无误的情况下我才把材料打印好封装在一个大牛皮纸信封里把它寄给了报社 写这份情况反映纯粹是我的个人行为并不是组织或领导交给我的任务我觉得作为一名普通的基层干部有责任和义务向上级部门或媒体反映发生在我们身边的一些应该引起关注和重视的真实现象我原本想直接把这份材料寄给中央领导转念一想觉得不妥因为他们日理万机太忙了偌大一个国家每时每刻要发生多少大事啊相比之下我反映的情况太微不足道了我可不想给他们添麻烦耽误他们的宝贵时间再说我的情况反映写的拉拉杂杂琐琐碎碎措辞造句也不讲究字数却超过了五万字冗长而又粗糙没办法我又没有润色修饰的本事只好寄给报社如果报社的大记者大编辑们能在百忙之中翻一翻瞄一眼然后引起他们的关注我就十分满意了我可不指望他们全文或摘要发表它噢对了还有一点我得郑重申明我写的可不是什么举报信或匿名信之类的告状材料我敢说我写的材料和我的名字一样真实所以我把自己的通讯地址和真实姓名端端正正地署在了文字材料的最后 我做梦也没想到的事情发生了 两个月后我收到了报社寄来的报纸我的情况反映竟然发表在了该报的副刊上而且是连载连载了半个月 我吓坏了不仅我的名字作为作者印在了报纸上而且我材料里出现的真人真名也未加任何技术性处理地公开示众更让我大惑不解的是报纸把我写的材料当成了中篇小说而刊登在精彩阅读的栏目下 于是我就突如其来莫名其妙地成了作家而且是当红作家 报社打电话约我写一篇创作谈还要搞一个长篇专访因为小说发表后在读者中引起了强烈轰动他们要窥视小说作者的私人生活 我一连几个月睡不踏实我躲到一个朋友家里惶惶不可终日朋友误认为我是杀人畏罪潜逃怕受到牵连背着我报了警警察呼啸而来不由分说就把我拷起来带走了好在我们生活在一个法制的社会多数人还是能依法办事警官们虽然一开始把我的交代视为痴人说梦天方夜谭是对国家机器的戏弄和公安人员智商的嘲讽但是最终他们还是接受了我那绘声绘色的解释他们不仅把我放了临别时还请我在他们的调查笔录上签名留念 这篇名字叫情况反映的中篇小说被多家报纸杂志转载最后竟被评为当年的年度小说金奖我一直没敢回家至今仍寄住在一个偏远的亲戚家里我不敢去参加什么隆重的颁奖典礼更不想惹出什么新的麻烦我在电话里跟老婆检讨千错万错都是自己的错我请她谅解并不要对孩子说出真相我妻子在一段时间内为我承受了很大的压力她面对着苍蝇似的记者和评论家不得不扯些谎话比方说他得了传染病不能接受采访或者他面部从小烧伤无法提供照片等等终于阻止了媒体进一步炒作的企图 老婆的临危不惧和宽宏大量让我感恩戴德她平生讨厌的就是作家我也搞不懂在她的内心深处怎么会把作家和流氓骗子画上了等号我通过熟人向她传话等这场风波过后我一定重新做人决不再写什么情况反映之类的臭东西了 8秘诀 我没想到老余的酒量那么小两盅酒下肚就开始犯迷糊了 算啦算啦咱还是改喝啤酒吧我看他哆哆嗦嗦地还想往杯子里倒酒赶紧劝他 没事儿今天我高兴老余满脸通红确实有些兴奋

从小学到中学他穿着校服上面也有字那是校名衣服虽然难看但必须成天穿在身上不管走在哪里人家一眼就认出你来有一回他在书店里偷偷地往怀里塞了本红岩让人告到了学校就是因为校服上印着学校的名字还有一次他放学时路过一家纺织厂那里着了火他跟着端水灭火人家专门给校长写了封感谢信也是校服上的名字起了作用那年夏天他不慎掉进了下水井路人救了他帮他包扎好头上的口子又把他送回了学校也是校服帮了他的忙 中学毕业后孙子孝参了军穿上了绿军装他更成了组织上的人了那时人们都喊他小孙或小孙同志 小孙脱下了军装又穿上了警服小孙变成了大孙大孙复员后当了十多年的警察那身制服让同学朋友街坊邻居们既羡慕又敬畏 警察提前退了休大孙变成了老孙老孙在家闲不住又穿上了保安的制服在宾馆门口替客人开门或引导客人停车那身服装减少了老孙不少失落感使他又打起了精神 老孙改不了当警察时养成的一些坏习惯他动手打人致伤被抓了进去他说监狱里也穿着统一服装上面还编着号只是没有警察制服的质料好也不挺括 老孙在监狱里没待多久就保外就医了他说他现在还是穿着统一的服装那是病号服医院里发的老孙住的是临终关怀医院他得了肝癌 老孙目前最大的愿望是将来到了另外一个世界也能穿上统一样式的衣服他说他一生在组织里呆惯了如果不穿上跟别人一样的衣服他就觉得自己是个另类找不着感觉 10试验 有些人总想赶时髦却老是落伍在这方面我可是个幸运儿不管你信不信反正几乎所有的新鲜事儿我都摊上了这倒不是说我愿意赶时髦只是我的运气比别人好总能赶上试验性开创性的好事儿 刚生下来时医院的大夫说婴儿在母腹的羊水里就有了游泳的基础拿我做演示把我扔进浴盆里差一点呛死我 三岁时卫生部门要打一种传染病疫苗要找一批孩子做试验我荣列其中一针下去我的胳膊肿得比碗口粗头发一根不留地掉光了到现在还亮晃晃的 上小学时进入试验班满堂灌一些据说是连博士都搞不大懂的知识全班同学有一多半不到两个月就进了精神病院这其中也有我一个 读中学时校长突然宣布让我们班使用试验教材一学期下来参加全市联考全班没一个达到及格线于是我和其余的同学统统成了留级生多念了一年 正因为这多出的一年时间使我们又赶上了不用考试就可以读大学的机会全部到边远的乡下去到广阔的天地读一本苦书分数按手上的老茧的厚度来计算 在农民老师别出心裁的教育下我断了只手那是在采石场里掌钎时被房东家二傻子用大炮锤生生砸烂的当时我是作为头一个左右手各扶一钎的试验者被队长选中的于是我毕了业回了城 当工人到车间的第一天厂子里试行超负荷工作法我三天三夜没合眼只用一只手便完成了常人半个月才能干完的活儿我被誉为独臂英雄厂长本想和我握手以资鼓励只可惜厂长伸出的手又缩了回去我仅有的一只手正忙着抹眼泪呢 由于上级重视把我们厂作为纯洁阶级队伍的试点单位说取得经验后在全国推广 我们兴奋极了上下努力了三个月有八成的工人被封上了各种罪名全都离开了岗位我比他们幸运在这场试点中只打瘸了条腿 再后来我们又回到了厂里没过多久又开始做优化组合的试点改革我首当其冲地成了优化掉的典型工友们在大门口夹道欢送我那场面可感人了 我现在住进了医院这也是试点医院专门收留像我这样的久经考验的无依无靠的患者大夫说我患上了他从医以来所见所闻所学到的所有疾病他准备拿我做试验用各种新发明的药物对我进行综合治疗我爽快地同意了因此每天给我看病的大夫特别多有来进修的医生有参加实习的学生还有成批成批的参观者我受到了医学界的关注享受到了无微不至的关怀和呵护 我曾偷偷地问我的主治大夫我到底得了什么病能不能先告诉我几种病的名字我很好奇大夫有些不耐烦他劝我不要着急说等到尸体解剖时一切都清楚了 我感谢医院的周到考虑我请求他们再拿我做一次试验如果能在我还清醒的时候就动手解剖那效果一定会更好 11呵斥 在我即将和这个世界说再见的时候总想给后辈们留下点什么 我一贫如洗只剩下一座储量丰富的金矿那是我一辈子梦中常看到的金灿灿地带醒来时便化为乌有 作为年逾八旬的老人人生经验是可传给后人的最贵重的财富了我不想把它带到另一个世界我要毫不保留地告诉各位 我认为在人类的所有教育方式中呵斥是最普遍也是最有效的方式直到今天我才悟出了这个秘密和真谛 别动扎手这是我降生不久后听到的发自妈妈口中的第一声呵斥我那时仅仅是想挥动着小手试图去够一根闪闪发亮的别针 站到墙边去小心你的屁股上幼儿园的头一天老师就大声警告我还冲着我扮凶恶的鬼脸因为我打翻了饭碗 不准你吃饭看我不打断你的狗腿上小学时我太喜欢我的班主任了于是给她取了个爱称叫大眼贼没想到喊出来后老师不但不领情反而错误地理解了我的本意哭着向我的父母告状父母几乎异口同声地向我吼了一句还好我从未养过狗因此他们没有打断过我的狗腿 你这个混账你的皮子又紧了这是在我中学时期父亲常对我传递的信息声调往往是恶狠狠的那时我非常讨厌我的同桌一位比其他女孩发育早一截的妖精她总让我心神不宁每当她的胳膊从桌子中线越过来碰到我时特别是夏天总让我有一种异样的感觉于是我就准备了一根大头针予以反击且屡试不爽哎呀一声令我痛并快乐着 你就像个二流子永远没出息刚走上社会时不想当劳模一门心思扮酷穿戴让父母看不惯早晨不起晚上不睡的生活规律也让他们愤愤不平 没有人惯你好不容易找到份工作领班整天盯着你上趟厕所他还计时他常呵斥的内容还有你不想要工钱了快干活去懒鬼呸你小子是不是想被收拾了 我叫你嘴硬你等着瞧吧结婚后不久有时夜里回家老婆总这么喊后来几十年的主题语是呸窝囊废瞧你那德性滚蛋你给我滚蛋我一辈子再也不想看到你你是个王八蛋当然她也有自我反省的时候比如我算瞎了眼了倒了八辈子的大霉竟然嫁给了你 你真是老糊涂了越老越不正经丢人现眼老伴死后六年我觉得邻居夏老太太人挺好一个人守了大半辈子寡无儿无女怪孤独的我想搬过去住被儿子严词拒绝了 呸老不死的光会吃闲饭不会干人活儿媳在厨房里骂猫声音很大她是个好人若不是她对我们家的那只老猫有意见我至今也不会住进养老院里 你发什么呆是不是又尿裤子啦幸亏这一嗓子要不我还不知要写到什么时候了 快到墙根站着让太阳晒晒老 我耳朵有些背了不知道养老院的管理员喊我老什么大概是老祖宗吧 你说我说得对吗呵斥真是我们人类的光荣传统哎 12丢人 我从未见过他如此沮丧他觉得自己窝囊透了 我试图劝劝他可他坚决地冲我摆摆手谢绝了我的好意 他说你别站着说话不腰疼这事儿要是换给你你能不堵得慌吗我跟你讲谁劝都不好使说什么都是风凉话我听着都刺耳不舒服你懂吗 我不好再开口了只能礼节性地点点头 老兄他说我的面子都丢尽了这张脸连猴腚都不如老婆跟人跑了跟一个烧锅炉的临时工跑了你说我这张脸往哪儿放丢死人啦我这些日子恨不能找个地沟钻进去真的没脸见人啊你是我哥们儿你给评个理是不是那么回事儿每天上班我巴不得把脑袋低到裤裆里就怕碰到熟人谁不笑话我你说啊别一个人傻坐着 哪有人笑话你净瞎扯其实我心里挺同情他的 谁笑话你别跟我打岔综合处的那个刘秃子就直截了当地瞧不起我你瞧他那副德性要不是他老婆先下手一步哪有他那份风光自从他老婆跟孙副局长上了床你看他整天仰着个秃瓢腆着个鸡胸连上电梯都要挤在前面有什么他妈的了不起的不就是因为他老婆傍住了一个快退休的副局长吗要是局长先认识我老婆哪有他老婆的机会 我呆坐在那里脑袋里嗡嗡地响 他妈的我老婆真不争气非要跟个烧锅炉的勾搭一点品位都没有算我瞎了眼跟她倒了大霉他又把小酒壶从兜里掏出来使劲喝了一口 还会有机会的你老婆不会执迷不悟的她跟那个锅炉工跑到乡下过不了多久就会回来的我幸灾乐祸地劝他 没那个机会了人家局长能看上个跟锅炉工相好的女人算了吧我这辈子没什么盼头了只能在收发室里打打杂了不像你老兄你行我看你有机会他比刚才更兴奋了 我可不行我又不认识你老婆再说就算你愿意那个烧锅炉的家伙还不跟我玩命啊我不敢再待下去起身往外跑 呸他在我身后狠狠地啐了一口2
